<p>Once upon a time, during a great battle which
was fought through the night in a tempest of
lightning and rain, a brave young grenadier
came upon one of the enemy lying sorely
wounded on the field. Taking pity upon his
foeman, the soldier bound up his wounds and
carried him from the battle to the shelter of a
little wood. Scarce had the wounded youth
opened his eyes, when amid a blinding flash of
lightning and a peal of tumbling thunder, a
green chariot drawn by green dragons rushed
downward through the hurrying clouds and
sank to earth at the soldier’s side. Bidding the
dragons be still, a tall, dark, and stately man
wearing a long green mantle descended from
the chariot, took the wounded lad in his arms,
and thus addressed the grenadier:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Generous friend, to you I owe the life of my
youngest son. I am the Enchanter of the Green
Glen. Take you this little green wand in memory
of the great debt I owe you. Whatsoever
you strike once with it will continue to grow
larger till you cry ‘stop’; whatsoever you strike
twice with it will grow smaller till you bid the
magic cease. Farewell, brave soldier, and may
good fortune walk forever by your side.”</p>

<p>Then, wrapping his wide green mantle about
the body of his son, the Wizard bade his scaly,
yellow-eyed dragons be on their way, and
vanished on high in the tempest and the dark.</p>

<p>And now the wars were over and done, and
the soldier found himself mustered out and
turned loose to earn his living in the world.
Still clad in his grenadier’s uniform, and wearing
his blue greatcoat buttoned close about
him, he slung his knapsack to his shoulder,
fastened it to his belt in front by crossed straps
of white leather, put on his big shiny hat, and
turned from the camp over the hills and
far away.</p>

<p>It was the early autumn of the year: great
roaring gusts swept by overhead, singing shrilly
through the withered leaves still clinging to the
branches, apples lay red ripe in the frost-nipped
grass, and the country folk were gleaning in the
stubble of the fields. On through the villages
went the soldier, hoping to find work for the
winter among the farms; he knocked at this
door and at that, but ever in vain. Presently
the mighty summits of the Adamant Mountains,
gleaming with new-fallen snow, rose beyond
the bare woods and the lonely fields.
Following the great royal road, the soldier
tramped on into the very heart of the mountain
mass.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall meet with better luck in the
kingdoms beyond the peaks,” thought the
grenadier, as he trudged along. How still it
was! Now the soldier could hear the roaring
of the river in the gorge below the road, now
the cry of the eagles circling high above some
desolate crag.</p>

<p>At high noon on the third day, the soldier
arrived at the brazen column which marks the
descent of the royal road to the kingdoms beyond
the hills. A biting wind, keen with the
smell of snow, blew from the surrounding peaks,
and made the soldier very hungry indeed. Sheltering
himself against the giant column, he
slipped his knapsack from his shoulder, and
looked within for the last of the bread and
cheese which a good wife of the mountain villages
had given him the day before. Alas, there
was but the tiniest crust of bread to be found,
and the littlest crumb of cheese! Suddenly, as
he fished about in the sack, the grenadier discovered
the little green wand. He had quite
forgotten it. A notion came into his head to try
the magic, and he struck the bit of bread one
smart tap.</p>

<p>The moment he did so, the fragment of bread
bounced a few inches into the air, and fell back
to the ground; soon it was the size of a loaf of
bread; a moment or two later the loaf had
grown to the size of a table; soon the mass of
bread was the size of a small house. And it was
growing, growing, growing.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the soldier. The magic ceased.
The soldier struck the mountain of bread <i>twice</i>.</p>

<p>Again it leaped into the air, but this time it
began to grow less. Like to a candle end in the
fire, it began to vanish before the soldier’s eyes.
Presently it was once more the size of a generous
loaf, and thus the soldier bade it remain. Next
he enchanted the bit of cheese to an ample size,
and found himself provided with victuals fit
for a king. Later, when he had eaten his fill, he
amused himself by enchanting a pebble into a
great rock. And that rock may be seen in the
Adamant Mountains <i>to this very day</i>!</p>

<p>At the end of a week’s journey the soldier
reached the Golden Plain, which lies between the
Adamant Mountains and the sea.</p>

<p>Now at the time of the soldier’s arrival, the
people of the Golden Plain were being day by
day swept to hunger and ruin by the devastation
wrought throughout their land by a hippodrac.
Driven by hunger, so some thought, from
its stony lair in the forests of the sun, this terrible
creature had suddenly swooped down on
the harvest fields a month before, and had
roamed the land till the precious grain had for
the most part been consumed or destroyed.
Worse yet, the hippodrac was even then breaking
open the royal granaries, in which lay
such grain as the citizens had been able to
store away.</p>

<p>This terrible creature, I must tell you, was a
kind of fearsome winged horse. It was larger
than any earthly animal, black as midnight in
color, and armored over the chest and head
with a sheath of dragon’s scales. Add to this a
pair of giant wings, black and lustrous as a
raven’s, a wicked horse-like head with huge
jaws, hoofs of blue steel, and an appetite like a
devouring flame, and you will see that the
people of the Golden Plain had true cause for
alarm. Black wings outspread, blue hoofs
plunging, roaring from the fiery pits of its
violet nostrils, the hippodrac was master in
the land.</p>

<p>In the hope of ridding themselves of the monster,
the people of the Golden Plain offered a
huge treasure to whosoever might conquer the
invader. In true soldier fashion the grenadier
resolved to fight the hippodrac, and win fame
and fortune at a blow.</p>

<p>Now the Lord Chancellor of the realm, who
ruled the land during the minority of the Princess
Mirabel, had no intention whatever of paying
the promised reward. Not only had this
wicked man stolen so much money from the
royal treasury that scarce was a penny left,
but also was he miserly, cruel, and avaricious.
Torn between fear of the hippodrac and fear of
having to empty his own money-bags of the
stolen gold in order to pay the reward, the
Chancellor wandered back and forth all day
through the castle halls. Thus far, however, no
one had ever returned to claim the treasure.</p>

<p>After talking with some who had seen the
hippodrac, the soldier retired to a little inn to
make his plans. Sitting alone in a great settle
by the fire, he watched the flames grow ruddier
as the afternoon sun sank below the western
hills. Presently it was night, a night quiet,
cool, and bright with great winter stars.</p>

<p>The grenadier made his way unobserved out
of the royal city, and soon arrived in the
midst of the ruined and trampled fields. Here
the grain had been gathered, bound in sheaves,
and left to perish when the harvesters fled; here
the uncut stalks had withered in the ground;
here stood a house from which everyone had
run for his life. Presently the soldier beheld,
standing apart on a lonely hill, the crumbling
towers of the ruined castle which served as the
hippodrac’s den.</p>

<p>A late, wasted, half-moon began to rise. The
soldier made his way up the slope, and peered
through the doorless portal into the moonlit
ruin.</p>

<p>At the end of the great entrance-hall of the
castle, its monstrous head resting on the lowest
step of the winding stair which led to the roofless
banqueting-hall above, lay the monster.
The rays of the waning moon, slanting through
the broken tracery of a great window, fell on its
vast bulk; a rumbling breathing alone disturbed
the starry silence of the night.</p>

<p>“I must make my way down those stairs,”
said the grenadier to himself, and crept off to
seek a way to the banqueting hall above.
Finally he managed to find a little stairway in
a ruined turret. Creeping along softly, ever so
softly, over the floor of the banqueting hall, he
reached the head of the great stair and looked
down its curving steps to the monster asleep
below. Then, step by step by step, the grenadier
approached the hippodrac.</p>

<p>Suddenly the soldier’s foot dislodged a piece of
clattering stone. The hippodrac awoke with a
scream, but the soldier struck it <i>two</i> swift taps
with the little green wand.</p>

<p>The instant he did so, the hippodrac uttered
a cry of fright and rage which waked the good
folk of the city in their beds, and bounced,
wings beating wildly, in the air. The grenadier
took refuge at the head of the balustrade.
Smaller and smaller grew the furious and bewildered
beast. Now it had shrunk to the size
of a pony, now it had dwindled to the size of a
dog, now it was scarce larger than a kitten.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried the grenadier. Wild with fright,
the tiny monster took wing, and fluttered like a
terrified bird into a corner of the ruins. And
there, beating about and flapping its wings
madly, the grenadier caught it in his high hat,
and shook it into his knapsack. This done, he
walked swiftly back to the inn, and went to bed.</p>

<p>Now one of the Lord Chancellor’s rascals had
been on watch for his return, and when the
grenadier returned with the light of victory in
his eyes, this spy ran to inform his rogue of a
master. Suspecting magic of some kind, the
wicked Chancellor made his way to the inn, and
stole the green wand while the soldier slept.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><i>Suddenly the soldier’s foot dislodged a piece of clattering stone,
and the hippodrac awoke</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Early the next morning, the soldier sent word
to the counselors of court that he had mastered
the hippodrac, and waited their good pleasure
to prove the truth of his word. Within a very
short time a royal messenger appeared, summoning
him before the assembled court at the
tenth hour.</p>

<p>And now the soldier, carrying the tiny hippodrac
in his knapsack, was led to the judgment
hall of the royal palace. The Princess
Mirabel sat on the throne of the realm, whilst
the Lord Chancellor stood by her side, a smile
of triumph on his wicked lips. But the soldier
had eyes only for the young Princess, who was
as fair as the first wild rose of the year. As for
the Princess, it must be confessed that she
thought the stalwart young grenadier with the
black hair and the blue eyes quite the most
pleasant person she had ever seen.</p>

<p>Simply and modestly the grenadier told the
story of his capture of the hippodrac. Leaning
forward a little, the Princess listened eagerly.</p>

<p>“And your proof of this&mdash;?” questioned the
Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>“Is here,” replied the grenadier, and opening
his knapsack, he took from it the hippodrac and
placed it on the carpet just before the throne.
As the soldier had taken the precaution to clip
the monster’s wings, the tiny thing could do
naught but dance with rage on its little blue
hoofs, and lash out madly right and left in a
frenzy of fear. A murmur of astonishment rose
from the assembly. There was a great craning
of necks. All present looked at the Lord Chancellor
to hear what he might say.</p>

<p>“That little thing, the great hippodrac?”
said the Lord Chancellor, evilly. “Pooh! ’T is
a juggler’s kitten, rather. I shall give no reward
for this.”</p>

<p>“You dare?” cried the grenadier fiercely.
“Wait!” And he reached in his pocket for the
little green wand, but, alas, the little green
wand was gone.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said the Chancellor again, watching,
with contented eyes, the poor grenadier madly
thrusting his hands into every pocket, “You
see he cannot do as he pretends. The fellow
is an impostor. Ho, guards! Take this rogue
and his dancing kitten off to prison.”</p>

<p>“But it looks like the hippodrac,” protested
the Princess.</p>

<p>“No! Not a bit of it, not a bit of it!” roared
the Chancellor. And he quickly silenced all
those who were fain to see justice done, by
threatening to send any objector to the royal
diamond-mines in the Adamant Mountains.</p>

<p>Left to himself in a lonely cell of the royal
prison, the poor grenadier awaited the day of
his departure for the mines. Finding the time
hang heavy on his hands, he amused himself
by trying to tame the tiny hippodrac. To his
surprise and pleasure, the fierce little creature
made a swift response. Soon it was eating
crumbs from his hand. In a fortnight it could
spell out words and letters by tapping the floor
with its right foreleg! And day by day, its
clipped wings grew once more to full size.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you could only get me my green
wand again!” said the soldier one morning.</p>

<p>At these words, the hippodrac beat an excited
tattoo on the table, and before the soldier
could seize it, spread its little gleaming wings,
and fled through the barred window out into
the world.</p>

<p>All day long the soldier waited its return. “It
has flown away forever,” he thought, as twilight
fell. A moment later, however, he heard a
whir of tiny wings, and the hippodrac returned,
the little green wand in its jaws. You may well
believe that the soldier was overjoyed! That
very night he found means to send a petition
to the Princess, asking to be brought before
her that he might at last prove the truth of
his story.</p>

<p>Now the Chancellor, knowing that his wicked
scheme had succeeded, and never dreaming of
the possibility of the grenadier’s escape, had
gone a-hunting: so the Princess took matters
into her own hands, and next morning summoned
the grenadier before the court. Alas!
Just as the grenadier reached the throne, the
Chancellor, hastily summoned by another of
his rascally spies, came striding angrily into
the judgment hall.</p>

<p>“What means this?” he roared. “How came
that fellow to be out of prison? Ho, guards,
take him back at once!”</p>

<p>“No!” said the little Princess bravely. “I
believe in him, and he shall have justice in
my realm!”</p>

<p>“Do you dare defy me?” cried the Chancellor.
“Guards, do your duty! I am Regent here.”</p>

<p>A handful of soldiers strode toward the grenadier.
With a smile on his lips and in his eyes,
the grenadier struck the hippodrac <i>one</i> smart
tap with the magic wand.</p>

<p>The creature bounced, and instantly began
to increase in size; suddenly it snorted fiercely
and reared on its hind legs; once again it
screamed even such a scream as it had uttered
when the grenadier enchanted it in the ruined
castle. People began to fly pell-mell in every
direction. Only Mirabel, who was a lass of
spirit, stood her ground.</p>

<p>When the hippodrac had reached its full size,
the soldier cried “Stop!” Then, for a moment,
the monster and the man gazed directly into
each other’s eyes. The soldier still smiled.</p>

<p><i>The hippodrac had understood.</i></p>

<p>Uttering now the angriest cry of all, the creature
darted forward, and seized the Lord Chancellor
by the scruff of his ugly neck. Then opening
wide its giant wings, it leaped up on all four
legs, and flying down the vast hall, crashed
through a great window and out into the freedom
of the cloudless sky. So terrified was it by
its experiences, that it flew back to its lair in the
forests of the sun, and never bothered anybody
any more.</p>

<p>On the way home, while flying at a great
height, it got bored with carrying the Lord
Chancellor and let him drop. No one has since
heard of this personage. No one ever will.</p>

<p>When the excitement subsided, the citizens
hailed the grenadier as the preserver of their
country and offered him the treasure which the
Chancellor had stolen away. But the grenadier
had already found a treasure much more to his
liking&mdash;the Princess Mirabel. The handsome
young couple were married with great pomp
and ceremony on New Year’s day.</p>

<p>And thus the brave grenadier became a
king, and with Mirabel by his side, ruled
over the Golden Plain for many a long and
happy year.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_PALACE_OF_THE">THE PALACE OF THE
NIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time there was an Emperor of the
Isles, who had but one son, the Prince Porphyrio.
On the day which beheld the Prince’s coming of
age, the Emperor summoned the youth to his
council chamber, and said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dear son, when you were a little child, I
pledged to you the hand of the Lady Liria,
daughter of my friend and ally, the Emperor of
the Plain. You are now of age, and I would fain
send you forth to find the Princess and win her
for your own.”</p>

<p>Then replied the tall, golden-haired Prince,
“Dear father, give me but a brave ship and a
gallant crew, and I will this very eve set sail for
the Emperor’s city and greet the Lady Liria.”</p>

<p>Pleased with this speech, the Emperor gave
orders that a fine ship be swiftly prepared for
the voyage. And this was done.</p>

<p>And now it was night, and the vessel lay waiting,
her sails gleaming green-white in the moonlight,
her ladder shrouds gently swaying
against the pale and starry sky. When came
the ebb of the midnight tide, the anchors
were weighed, the great sails trimmed to the
breeze, and the vessel piloted forth to the measureless
plain of the sea.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, as the great ship sped
upon her furrowed way, that Porphyrio took it
into his head to visit the Fair of the Golden
Bear, and fled before the wind to the festival
city. Little by little&mdash;for the air was but light&mdash;the
ship left behind her the blue of the deeps,
and entered the green waters of the shallows.
Suddenly there was a cry of “Land Ho!” and
from afar, over the landward hastening waves,
Porphyrio beheld the great tower of the Fair.
A giant golden image of a bear, standing erect,
crowned the high tower-top, and shone dully
bright above the haze.</p>

<p>At sundown the Prince, accompanied by his
mariners, found himself in the midst of the
great Fair, in the very heart of the din, the
medley of outlandish costumes, the babel of
strange tongues, and the shrill cries of the shopmen
and the merchants. Surely there was never
such a market place as the Fair of the Golden
Bear!</p>

<p>Everything in the world was there to be
bought and sold. At one booth a venerable man
in a scholar’s gown and velvet cap sold words&mdash;rare
words, rich words, strange words, beautiful
words, and drove a brisk trade with a crowd of
poets and lovers; at another an old woman in
green sold rosy glasses to those who were at outs
with the world; and at still another a joyous
fellow in blue offered sunbeams, which he had
caught in a mirror and imprisoned in bits of
magic glass.</p>

<p>Porphyrio was quite delighted with the sunbeams,
which shone night and day, like diamonds
aflame with golden fires. “The Lady
Liria will surely be pleased with one of these,”
thought he, and purchased the finest of all.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as he walked about
the Fair with his retinue of sailor-men, Porphyrio
caught sight of a rustic fellow in brown
corduroys who was carrying a sea bird in
a wicker cage. And because he loved the wild
folk of the sea, the Prince said to the countryman:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good friend, whither go you with your
bird?”</p>

<p>“To the animal merchants, sir,” replied the
fellow. “’Tis a wild bird which I found in my
field on a morning after a storm. Only look,
sir; it wears a circle of feathers on its head, for
all the world like a crown.”</p>

<p>“Why, so it does!” said the young Prince.
“Come, will you sell him to me?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, indeed, sir,” replied the countryman.
“’Tis yours for a florin of gold and a penny of
silver.” And he held out his hand for the sum.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Porphyrio, and he paid the
money. Then, to the countryman’s amazement,
he threw open the door of the cage, and
allowed the sea bird to escape. With a glad
cry, and a mighty beating of its gray wings,
the creature climbed into a splendor of the
sunset, dwindled to a black speck, and vanished
from their eyes.</p>

<p>Once more the Prince set sail. For a few days
the weather remained tranquil and fair. Then
came a night of cloud, and a rushing wind,
which increased during the day to a hurricane.
Now arose a great din, the howling of the wind
through the shrouds, the cracking and straining
of the timbers of the ship, the cries of the
sailors, and the roaring and foaming of the
deep. All night long, through the wild ocean
dark, the Prince’s ship drifted nearer and nearer
the unknown waters of the Southern Sea. Suddenly,
just before the dawn, a tremendous noise
was heard; the vessel trembled throughout her
length, and crashing down once more on a
hidden reef, broke apart. A huge wave swept
Porphyrio from the deck, some wreckage
hurled itself upon him, and he knew no more.</p>

<p>When he woke again, close upon noon, he
found that the waves had carried him to the
stony beach of a dark and unknown isle. A
stately wall of cliffs of the strangest dark-blue
stone girdled it about; to the left, to the right,
the rampart swept, solemn, unscalable, and
huge. One broken mast of the Prince’s ship still
rose forlorn above the tumbling waters on the
reefs; but of the gallant crew there was never a
sign. With a heavy heart Porphyrio trudged
off to look for shelter and for aid. Long hours
followed he the curving shore, even till the sun,
which had been shining in his face, little by
little crept to the side and shone behind, yet
never a way to the headland’s height stood
forth in the sheer and sombre wall.</p>

<p>And now, of a sudden, and by great good fortune,&mdash;for
the tide was rising,&mdash;Porphyrio,
turning the base of an advancing crag, found
himself close by a noble promontory that sloped
from the cliff-top to foundations in the sea.
Half climbing, half dragging himself along the
stones and terraces of this ridge, the Prince
attained at last the height of the blue wall.</p>

<p>A great dark isle lay open before him&mdash;a
solitary isle of shadowy lands, gloomy woods,
and rocks and hillocks of the same dark stone
he had marked before. Save for the faint murmur
of the encircling sea below and the sighing
of the wind, the isle was as silent as a land beneath
the deep: indeed, so still and dark it was,
that it seemed as if the night reigned there, forever
untroubled by the day. In the very heart
of the gloom, its mighty walls and blue battlements
lifted high against cloud mountains
gathered in the west, a stately palace rose.</p>

<p>After a long, winding journey through a wood
dark as a leafy cave, Porphyrio arrived at the
portals of the dwelling.</p>

<p>The palace was as silent as a stone. Of silver
were its massy doors, and they were sealed and
barred, and from turret to foundation stone its
windows were with silver shutters closed against
the day. Not a sign or a memory of living
things was there to be seen.</p>

<p>Wondering in his heart at the mystery, Porphyrio
presently made his way into a noble
garden, wherein were pools and basins of blue
water rimmed about with silver, and tall, dark
trees stately as night. Again to his wonderment,
the Prince beheld that the flowers in the garden
were such as opened only in the night&mdash;the
pale, fragrant jasmine hid there, the moonflower
dreamed, and the shy star-daisy gathered
her petals before her face.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Prince heard steps behind him,
and turning swiftly, beheld a fair Princess gazing
at him with eyes in which wonder, alarm,
and hope might all be seen.</p>

<p>“Speak! Who are you? What do you here?”
said the Princess quickly.</p>

<p>To this Porphyrio replied that he was a prince
who had been shipwrecked on a voyage. And
he told the Princess of his adventures.</p>

<p>“Alas,” replied the lady, “You have come to
the dark land! Know you not into whose power
you have fallen? This dark isle is the dwelling
of the Magician of the Night, who rules the
fairy world from sunset to the morn. When
comes the dawn, his mighty power wanes, and
he and his people of the night hasten to this
locked and shuttered palace, here to lie hidden
from the sunlight which is their enemy and
deadly fear. I alone go forth, for I, alas, am
a mortal. But hearken to my story.</p>

<p>“I am the Princess Liria (Porphyrio started).
My father is the Emperor of the Plain. On
midsummer eve, as I was walking with my
handmaidens in the garden, a messenger from
my father arrived bidding me come at once to
the great hall of state. I obeyed the message,
and going to the hall, found there the Magician
of the Night, who had just presented a haughty
petition for my hand. Because of his fear of the
Magician, my father was very ill at ease. All
looked to me for an answer. I replied courteously
that, though I felt highly honored at the
demand, I nevertheless felt bound to refuse,
for I had been affianced since childhood to
another. For you must know, good Prince,
that my father was long the true friend and ally
of the Emperor of the Isles, and had pledged my
hand to his only son, the Prince Porphyrio.</p>

<p>“Would that this were all I had to tell! But&mdash;woe
to me!&mdash;scarce had the Magician, with a
mocking smile, bowed low and disappeared into
the night, when a terrible storm of his contriving
descended upon our unfortunate city, overturning
our tallest towers and strewing ruin
far and wide. Our torches quenched by the
rain and wind, my maidens and I took refuge
in a great chamber of the north turret. At the
height of the storm the wind suddenly burst
open the double portals, there came a great
flash of lightning and a roar of thunder, and I
beheld the Magician standing tall and motionless
between the doors, surrounded by a dozen
of his creatures of the night. I cried out, but
his servants seized me and led me forth; great
wings bore me upward through the very torment
of the heavens, a darkness fell on me, and
I knew no more. When I awoke, I found myself
here in the Palace of the Night.</p>

<p>“Farewell, dear land of the Golden Plain,
whose harvests I shall never more see! Farewell,
dear Prince Porphyrio of the Isles!”</p>

<p>“But I am Porphyrio!” cried the Prince,
“and I was on my way to find you, noble
Liria, when the storm swept me to this isle.”</p>

<p>You may be sure the heart of the Princess
leaped when she heard these tidings!</p>

<p>Forgetting that he was himself but a shipwrecked
wanderer much in need of aid, the
Prince, like the brave fellow that he was, could
think of nothing but of rescuing his lady from
the dark magician; as for the Princess, she
could think of naught but the plight of Porphyrio,
tossed friendless and forlorn upon the
isle. But at length she shook her head and
smiled.</p>

<p>“To-day,” said she, “is mine, and to-morrow
also; but the Magician has bidden me be prepared
for the wedding feast by sundown on the
following day. But, look, the shield of the sun
breaks the storm clouds close above the waters;
twilight approaches; the hour of the magician
is at hand; you must go. Hide yourself well
to-night, and come to the garden to-morrow
when the chimes ring thrice. On yon dark
wall you will find some strangely shaped fruits
growing; fear not to eat of them when you
hunger. Liria the Unhappy bids you farewell,
Prince Porphyrio.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, Princess,” replied Porphyrio. “Do
not despair. We shall yet outwit the dark
Magician!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now the Prince lay hid in the heart of
a great tree, watching the doors and windows
of the palace slowly opening in the twilight.
Suddenly huge bells swung forth in waves of
heavy sound, strange music played, and the
thousand windows filled with the magic glow
of moon-fire. All night long the people of the
night held festival; but at the break of dawn the
silver windows closed slowly on their hinges,
the music grew faint, and the murmur died
away.</p>

<p>On the second afternoon the Prince, in his
impatience, came early to the shadowy garden.
The Princess Liria was not to be found, so
Porphyrio wandered away into the dark alleys
by the pools. Suddenly he found himself looking
at his own reflection in a huge round mirror
which two marble statues supported between
them, one at each side. Happening to move a
little, the Prince discovered that his reflection
did not move! He lifted an arm, the image remained
motionless; he shook his head, the
mirror gave no sign. Puzzled, Porphyrio left
the spot, and saw his reflection remaining behind
the glass.</p>

<p>Presently he heard the welcome footsteps of
Liria. And as the lovers walked and talked and
discussed plans of escape, the Prince chanced to
tell of the mirror he had found. Uttering a little
gasp of alarm, the Princess cried: “Now we
are lost indeed! Yon mirror is a mirror of
memory, and reveals to the Magician the faces
of those who walk these paths. As soon as he
sees your reflection therein,&mdash;and he gazes into
the glass every eve,&mdash;his demons will be sent
in search of you. There is one hope and one only.</p>

<p>“Go you once more to the sea; follow the cliff
for a league to the west of the promontory, and
you will find at its base the opening of an ocean
cave. When you arrive there the tide will be at
half-flood, and the entrance will still be visible
above the waves. Fight your way within and
climb to the cavern’s height. Little by little the
rising tide will seal the portal and hide you from
the search. Make haste, dear Porphyrio, for
there is not an instant to lose! Oh, that I had
warned you!”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="palace"  style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/palace.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>The image in the mirror stood still</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Ragingly angry with himself for being a
meddlesome fool, Porphyrio hurried down to
the sea and sought out the cave. Twilight was
at hand; the tide was rising fast, already the
entrance was almost closed by the sea. Buffeted
by the breakers and tossed against the cliff as
he strode, the Prince at length made his way
into the cave and climbed to a shelf of rock
above the height of the tide. A few minutes
later, the water closed the entrance completely,
thus imprisoning Porphyrio in a hollow darkness
through which the ebb and flow of the
outer sea swept with chuckles and whispering
laughter. All night long waited Porphyrio in
the cold, watery dark.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the Prince’s vigil, the earth
suddenly shook, the waters hushed, and through
the silence and the dark Porphyrio heard the
long thunder of a mighty overthrow.</p>

<p>“What can that be?” thought he.</p>

<p>When the first red rays of the sun streamed
along the rocky floor of the cave, Porphyrio
descended from his refuge, and walked out of
the cave-mouth to the sea.</p>

<p>Now, as Porphyrio walked along the shore, it
came to pass that he discerned, deeply embedded
in the bluish sands and lashed about with
ropes of matted weed, the splendid painted
chest which had lain in his cabin on the
ship. Its brazen lock, though tarnished by
the waters, was still highly clasped; but sea
and stone had broken the wood loose from the
hasps, and the Prince had little difficulty in
raising the lid. With a rueful smile he gazed
down into his robes and fine array lying musty
and sand-strewn within. There lay his prince’s
circlet of gold, here his jeweled sword of state,
here the rich gifts he had meant for the Princess
Liria. And among these, tucked away in the
very corner of the chest, Porphyrio found the
sunbeam he had purchased at the Fair of the
Golden Bear.</p>

<p>“Were Liria armed with this,” cried he, “the
Magician of the Night could not prevail against
her!” At the thought, a new strength leaped
in his weary heart, and he hurried along the
cliff toward the promontory. The storm had
now cleared away, the ocean thundered and
broke into silvery white foam at the foot of
the blue ramparts, and the Isle of the Night
raised itself defiantly against a bright and
royal sun.</p>

<p>The Magician, however, had not been idle.
The mirror had told its story; a search had been
made; a legion of creatures had sought Porphyrio
in every corner of the isle. Compelled by the
approach of dawn to abandon this pursuit, the
Magician resolved to render the island unapproachable
from the sea. With a spell of tremendous
power he caused the promontory to
break from the other cliff and fall in scattered
and monstrous ruin to the beach below. It was
the thunder of this overthrow which had shaken
the earth and sounded through the cave.</p>

<p>As a last precaution, the Magician forbade
Liria to leave the Palace of the Night, and
locked and sealed the doors and windows,
every one.</p>

<p>Presently the Prince, hastening along the
beach, came in sight of the ruined headland,
and a great fear laid its icy hand on his heart
as he beheld the triumph of his enemy. How
was he to reach the headland height? The cliff-wall
now circled the entire island without a
break. League after league he trudged, along
the shore, through the tide, searching, searching
for some way to scale the overhanging walls.
Higher and higher climbed the sun. The shadows
fell to the east, the afternoon waned, and
still Porphyrio had found no path to the top.
Desperate at last, he attempted to scale the
steep face of the blue precipice. From ledge to
ledge, climbing with torn fingers and aching
arms, struggled the Prince, and presently, his
further advance barred, fell backward, faint
and overcome, on a shelf of rock high above
the sea.</p>

<p>When his strength returned, he found himself
close by an eyrie of sea birds brooding on their
nests in shelves and rifts of the rock. With a
great clamor of piping and crying the creatures
rose startled from their nests, so filling the air
with wings that Porphyrio closed his eyes.
Suddenly the master of the eyrie, uttering a
joyous call, swept down close to the Prince, and
with an upward surge of his heart Porphyrio
recognized the winged king whose freedom he
had purchased at the Fair of the Golden Bear!
And now the sea birds gathered about the
Prince, some gathering folds of his garments
into their talons, others lifting him on broad
wings, till presently he was borne from the narrow
ledge and the sound of the sea into the
splendor and silence of the sky.</p>

<p>The end of day was at hand. Unveiled of
any wisp of cloud, the fiery sun lay just above
the western waters, its lower rim almost resting
on the waves. Once again approached the
hour of the Magician of the Night.</p>

<p>The cloud of sea birds flew inland over the
blue isle, and settled to earth at the very doors
of the Palace of the Night. And opening his
arms to them, Porphyrio cried aloud his thanks
as they wheeled and fled.</p>

<p>The Prince walked boldly to the great door,
and blew a loud blast on the warder’s horn.
There came no answer to his call. The Palace
of the Night remained silent and dark. The
sun’s rim dipped; a little breeze made its way
from the sea through the mysterious gardens;
the flowers of the night stirred like sleepers in a
dream.</p>

<p>“O jewel of the sun,” cried Porphyrio, “Give
me now your aid!” And with these words he
touched the sunbeam to the lock. A crack resounded,
then a shattering crash, and the doors
swung open wide. Hastening on twixt other
and other doors and through heavy tapestries,
Porphyrio at length found himself at the thresh-hold
of the great hall of the Palace of the Night.
Rich hangings of dark blue velvet, strewn with
stars of silver and gold, hung from the giant
walls; a thousand lamps of pale moon-fire
swayed on silver chains from the unseen height
o’erhead; there were huge columns, and dark
aisles. To one side of the hall, by a silver throne
raised upon a dais, stood the Magician of the
Night, his arms folded on his breast. Proud
and pale by his side, near a second throne,
stood the Princess Liria. About them were
gathered the people of the Night.</p>

<p>As the doors parted, all turned to gaze at
Porphyrio.</p>

<p>Fixing his dark eyes upon the Prince, the
Magician spake a terrible incantation; but his
words shattered themselves against the sunbeam
as a threatening wave breaks to drift and
foam against a crag.</p>

<p>“Seize him!” commanded the Magician.</p>

<p>At these words a host of dark beings surged
about Porphyrio, encircling him, yet afraid to
attack. Porphyrio took Liria by the hand, and
led her toward the door. But even as he did so,
the Magician caused awesome silvery fires to
bar the outward way.</p>

<p>At the horizon’s edge, the waters were leaping
up about the sun.</p>

<p>Baffled by the flame, Porphyrio, still guarding
Liria, fought his way toward a great stair at
the very end of the hall. In the wall there,
barred with silver and shuttered with stone,
a giant circular window faced the west. And
now there rose a tumult through the hall,
and sounds of magic and thunder. Nothing
daunted, Porphyrio touched the sunbeam to
the window-bar, and threw the double shutters
open wide. The sun was yet above the wave,
sky and water were aflame, and the great tide
of sunlight swept into the Palace of the Night
like the music of many trumpets.</p>

<p>From all within the Palace a great wailing
cry arose that presently died away. When Porphyrio
and Liria turned to gaze, the Magician
and his people had vanished, conquered and
forever powerless. And the velvet hangings
were but cobwebs clinging to the walls, and the
lamps of moon-fire but empty shells.</p>

<p>Then Porphyrio and Liria walked hand in
hand to the darkening sea, and beheld there a
brave merchant-ship which the sea bird was
guiding to the isle. You may be sure it did not
take the jolly mariners long to rescue the lovers
from the headland! And thus the Prince and
Princess fared to Liria’s realm, where there their
marriage was celebrated with the greatest ceremony.</p>

<p>In time Porphyrio became a king and Liria
a queen, and thus they lived happily ever after.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ENCHANTED_BABY">THE ENCHANTED BABY</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time the King of a great country
had a quarrel with a goblin. Now it chanced
that the King had the best of the dispute, and
this so angered the goblin that he departed
from the realm and cast about for an opportunity
to do a mischief to his foe.</p>

<p>Now, as the goblin bided his time, it came to
pass that the King and the Queen, who had
long been childless, became the proud parents
of a bouncing baby boy. From rosy summer
morn to the murmuring quiet of a summer
night, the whole realm gave itself over to rejoicing.
Bells rang from the towers in cities
and steeples in the fields, cannon boomed from
castle towers, and small cakes, each one iced
with the Prince’s monogram in red and white
sugar, were distributed by royal command
among the children of the realm.</p>

<p>Now it was the custom of the country that
the heir to the throne be shown to the assembled
nobility of the realm on the first day of his
seventh week in this changing world of ours,
and presently this day stood at hand upon the
calendar.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the ceremony, the scene
within the great hall of the palace was magnificence
itself! Assembled by thousands and ten
thousands, the magnificoes of the land, all in
ceremonial attire, moved or tried to move
about; but as the huge hall was crowded to its
bulging doors, this was difficult, and there
were, I regret to say, the usual faintings from
lack of air, cries of protest, bad-tempered
pushing, caps knocked awry, crumpled ruffs,
and lost jewels.</p>

<p>Suddenly the great bell of the palace set up a
ponderous and solemn booming&mdash;the ceremony
was about to begin! Mercilessly crowding
back the already densely jammed magnificoes
on the toes of still other magnificoes, a
number of gentleman ushers contrived to open
an aisle the length of the hall, and when this
feat had been accomplished, the two tallest
sergeants in the royal army opened the double
portals leading forth from the royal drawing-room.
And now, heralded by a great ringing
peal of golden trumpets, and accompanied by a
crash of exultant thunder on the palace organ,
a noble procession slowly advanced through the
gateway into the hall. The generalissimo of the
royal armies came first, marching solemnly and
quite alone, for he was marshal of the occasion;
then came trumpeters in green and yellow; then
a chosen detail of giant grenadiers dressed in
rose-red and silver-grey; then pages scattering
flowers from golden baskets; then a little
space; and then, advancing with the dignity of
a cloud; appeared the Lord Chancellor, wheeling
in the baby.</p>

<p>Of finest yellow gold were the wheels and push-bar
of the perambulator, whilst the carriage
part had been hollowed from a single stupendous
opal! Amid a deafening din of huzzas
and shouts and bell clangs, the procession
solemnly advanced to a dais raised at the head
of the hall.</p>

<p>Suddenly an invisible shape fluttered in
through a window, muttered something beside
the baby’s cradle, uttered a mocking goblin
laugh, and fled away unperceived and unsuspected.</p>

<p>After wheeling the baby to the centre of the
dais, the Lord Chancellor gave a signal to the
trumpeters to break into the national anthem,
and bent over the cradle to take the infant and
show him to the throng. To his horror, the
cradle was <i>empty</i>! The little Prince’s pillow
was there, the coverlet edged with turquoise,
and the rattle filled with seed pearls&mdash;but
no baby.</p>

<p>“The baby! The baby! Where’s the baby?”
gulped the Lord Chancellor, scarce able to
speak. An awkward pause followed: excited
whispers, conjectures, rumors buzzed through
the audience. Presently, as the truth began to
spread, a growing uproar rocked the hall. Soon
everybody was busily looking here and there&mdash;lifting
up edges of carpets, poking about behind
curtains, staring at the ceiling, and examining
corners.</p>

<p>All at once a baby’s cry was heard, faint to be
sure, but quite unmistakable.</p>

<p>“Search, search, my friends!” cried the King.
“The Grand Cross of the Order of the Bluebird
to whosoever discovers my child!”</p>

<p>The baby’s cry was heard again! Where could
he be?</p>

<p>Suddenly a clever young lady-in-waiting, who
had been searching the opal carriage, uttered a
piercing shriek. While groping about in the
perambulator, she had felt the baby, but had
been unable to see him. Like a sudden crumbling
of walls, the dreadful truth broke upon
everyone present.</p>

<p><i>The baby had become invisible!</i></p>

<p>Invisible he was, and invisible he remained.
You may well believe that his upbringing was
indeed a difficult task! To make matters worse,
it was soon discovered that not only was the
Prince himself totally invisible, but also that
such clothes as touched him became invisible,
too. One could <i>feel</i> the little Prince, one could
<i>hear</i> him&mdash;and that was all. Thus, if he
crept away on the nursery floor, one had either
to grope for him through the clear air, carefully
feeling here and feeling there, or wait until he
cried. No wonder the poor Queen was forever
searching the land for new nurses-in-waiting,
and forever sending home nurses whose nerves
had proved unequal to the strain! One could
never tell what might be happening.</p>

<p>On one occasion, for instance, the child actually
managed to escape from his nursery to the
sweeping lawns of the royal palace, and the
entire national army, working in scout formation,
had to spend the whole afternoon creeping
about on its hands and knees before the prince
was found asleep in the shelter of a plum tree.</p>

<p>Now, when every attempt to undo the spell
had failed, it came to pass that the King went
to visit the Wise Man of Pansophia, a learned
sage who sat in a wing chair beneath a green
striped umbrella at the crossroads of the world,
giving counsel to all comers. This sage was clad
in the stately folds of a full black gown, a
round black velvet cap rested on the crown of
his snow-white head, a broad white beard lay
spread upon his breast, and on his nose were
huge round spectacles, over whose edge he
looked with an air of solemn authority.</p>

<p>Beginning at the umbrella, an army of questioners,
patiently waiting in single file, stretched
dozens of miles across the rolling land and disappeared,
still unbroken, over the crest of a
distant hill. These patient folk, it is a pleasure
to relate, courteously gave way to the unhappy
King.</p>

<p>When he had heard the King’s story, the Wise
Man shook his venerable head, and replied
in a voice which sounded like the booming of
waves on a resounding shore:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The spell which binds your son is a mighty
one, and can only be removed by touching him
with the spell-dispeller, the all-powerful talisman
given your ancestor, King Decimo, by his
fairy bride.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” replied the King, “the spell-dispeller
was stolen from the royal treasury twenty years
ago. Could you not tell us who stole it, or
where it may be found?”</p>

<p>“Was it not the only spell-dispeller in the
whole wide world?” questioned the Wise Man.</p>

<p>“It was,” replied the King with a sad, assenting
nod.</p>

<p>“Then it was stolen from you by the Master
Thief of the Adamant Mountains,” boomed the
Wise Man.</p>

<p>“And perhaps <i>you</i> can tell us where <i>he</i> can be
found,” said the King. The Wise Man shook
his head.</p>

<p>“Ask me where lies the raindrop which fell
yesterday in the river,” replied the Wise Man,
“but ask me not where dwells the Master
Thief. I do not know. No one knows. But as
for breaking the spell, it is the spell-dispeller or
nothing. Would that I could help you more!”</p>

<p>And, bidding the King a ceremonious farewell,
the sage turned his attention to the questioner
at the head of the long line, a stout peasant-fellow
whose cottage chimney failed to draw.</p>

<p>But now you must hear of the Master Thief of
the Adamant Mountains.</p>

<p>This mysterious personage, of whom all had
heard, but whom none had seen, dwelt in a
secret house in a lost valley of the mountains, a
house so artfully shaped and so cunningly concealed
with vines and branches, that the very
birds of the air were deceived by it and would
often come to roost on the chimney, mistaking
it for a chestnut tree! As for the Master Thief
himself, a kind of living bean-pole was he, for
he was taller than the tallest, leaner than the
leanest, and provided with a pair of long, tireless
legs which could outrun and outlast the
swiftest coursers in the land.</p>

<p>During the night, he moved through the
world in a strange garment of pitchy blue-black,
fitted as close to him as the skin to an
eel; during the day, he wore a marvelous vesture
on which were painted leaves, spots of sun,
dabs of blue shade, and stripes of earthy brown.</p>

<p>Now this Master Thief was no ordinary robber,
for he stole not for stealing’s sake, but only
to gather new rarities for a wonderful museum
he housed in the caverns under his dwelling.
Surely there was never such a marvelous
museum as the museum of the Master Thief!</p>

<p>Deep in the solemn echoing caves, ticketed
and labeled each one, and arranged in order,
shelf on shelf, was to be found the <i>finest specimen</i>
of everything in the world which men had
made or loved. The most comfortable chair in
the world was there, the pointedest pin, the
warmest blanket, the loudest drum, the stickiest
glue, the most interesting book, the funniest
joke, the largest diamond, the most lifelike
stuffed cat, the handsomest lamp-shade, and
a thousand things more. To relabel his collection,
to move it about, to do things to it
and with it was the supreme delight of the
Master Thief. Seated in the most comfortable
chair in the world, finger tips together, he
spent hours gloating on his treasures, and
wondering if he lacked aught beneath the sun.
Presently he chanced to hear of the invisible
baby’s opal perambulator, and instantly determined
to add this new wonder to his gallery.</p>

<p>Going first to his secret den, he spun for himself
a globe of delicate glass, spoke five words
into it, and sealed them snug within. Next, he
attired himself in his parti-colored suit, put the
globe in his pocket, and fled on his long legs
over hill and over dale to the royal city.</p>

<p>Arriving late in the afternoon, he made his
way without difficulty into the gardens of the
palace. The day was fair as only a day on the
threshold of summer may be, and the opal
perambulator stood unattended in the shade
of a clump of ancient trees. Magnificently clad,
a number of royal nurses were standing about
the silver fence which enclosed the prince’s
romping-yard. Far off, in the sunny distance,
sounded the drums and fifes of the palace
soldiery.</p>

<p>And now, creeping nearer unobserved, the
Master Thief took the crystal globe from his
pocket and tossed it near the group. Striking
the ground, the globe burst with the faintest
crystal tinkle, and the words that the cunning
Master Thief had sealed within escaped into
the air. And these words were:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Oh, look at the balloon!</i></p>

<p>Immediately all the nurses looked to the sky
to see the imaginary balloon, and while they
were looking here and looking there, the Master
Thief sprang to the opal perambulator, released
the brake on the golden wheels, and,
pushing the carriage ahead of him, ran like
mad down the flower-bordered alleyways and
out the garden gates to the highroad.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="baby" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/baby.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>Over hill, over dale, in a long straight line, fled the Master Thief
with the golden perambulator</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Across the landscape in a long straight line
fled the Master Thief on his wonderful legs,
pushing the perambulator all the while. Now
they saw him bouncing it across furrowed
fields, now they saw it speed like a jeweled boat
through a sea of waving green grain, now they
beheld it scattering the silly sheep in the upland
wilds.</p>

<p>Presently the bells of the city set up the maddest
ringing; foot soldiers were turned out on
the roads, and squadrons of cavalry were sent
galloping after; but all in vain&mdash;the jeweled
carriage, blazing in the western glow, sped like
a meteor over the land. The last they saw of it
was a moving streak of light along the steep
slope of a mountain, a light which gleamed for
a moment on the crest like a large, misplaced,
and iridescent star, and then swiftly sank
from view.</p>

<p>When the Master Thief reached his secret
haven in the valley, he shouted aloud for triumph,
and swiftly wheeled the perambulator
down to the museum. <i>The most magnificent
perambulator in the world!</i> Once more drawing
forth the most comfortable chair, the
Master Thief sank into it and contemplated
his newest prize.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a strange sound, half cry, half
gurgle caused him to sit bolt upright. Had
someone discovered his secret treasury? What
could it mean? And now there came a second
cry which ended in a long protesting wail.</p>

<p>The Master Thief had stolen the invisible
baby along with the carriage!</p>

<p>Now the notion of having to take care of a
baby, of any baby, was a matter which might
well alarm the Master Thief; but as for an
<i>invisible</i> baby, that was indeed a trial! All at
once, however, the Master Thief slapped his
knee and chuckled for joy&mdash;he had thought
of the spell-dispeller! Holding aloft the brightest
lantern in the world, the robber made his
way to the little side-cavern in which he had
placed the talisman.</p>

<p>His heart jumped. The spell-dispeller was gone!</p>

<p>Baffled and perplexed, the Master Thief began
a nervous search of the little cavern; but never
a sign of the spell-dispeller could he find. Vowing
not to restore the Prince till he had found
the talisman and tested its power, the Master
Thief at length abandoned the search and
carried the Prince through the caverns to his
dwelling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now days passed, and months passed,
and even years, without bringing to light the
spell-dispeller. From an invisible infant the
Prince grew to be an invisible boy, whose
merry voice and friendly presence played about
the house of the Master Thief like a capful of
summer wind on a mountain lake.</p>

<p>Heigho, but after all it wasn’t so bad to be
invisible! One could see things and find things
hidden away from all other mortals; one could
climb to the side of a bird’s nest, sit still, and
watch the mother bird feed her young; one
could dive, unseen, into the clear, cold pools of
the mountain streams and pinch the lurking
trout by their rippling tails; one could follow
the squirrel to his secret granary!</p>

<p>Now, during the Prince’s fifteenth year, it
came to pass that the Master Thief suddenly
became ashamed of his wicked ways, so ashamed
indeed that he resolved not only to forgo further
<i>collecting</i> but also to return every single
thing he had stolen! The invisible Prince, I am
glad to tell you, was of the greatest possible
service to the Master Thief in this honest task.
And now, all over the kingdoms of the world,
people began to find their stolen possessions
waiting for them when they came down to
breakfast in the morning: the stuffed cat became
once more the pride of the Blue Tower,
the most interesting book went back to its
place on the shelves of the royal library, the
golden scroll of the funniest joke appeared as if
by magic on the wall of the king’s own room.
Alas for human waywardness, there were actually
people who had grown so accustomed to the
loss of their belongings that they reviled the
Master Thief for their return. Dreadful to relate,&mdash;the
style having changed,&mdash;the handsomest
lamp-shade was actually tossed in a
well!</p>

<p>At the end of the fifth year, the opal perambulator
and the invisible Prince were the only
two stolen things left to return. The invisible
youth was twenty years old. With a sorrowful
heart, for the youth was as dear to him as a
son, the repentant Master Thief began preparations
to restore prince and perambulator
to the unhappy parents.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, on the morning of
departure, the Master Thief descended for the
last time to the forlorn and dusty corridors of
his great museum and walked about the galleries,
leaving footprints in the dust and musing
on the glories that had been. Here had stood
the shiniest rubber-plant, here the most beautiful
hat-rack, here the only eraser which had
never rubbed a hole in the paper. A tear gathered
in his eye. He had loved them; he had
stolen them; he had restored them; he was free!</p>

<p>All at once his glance, roving empty shelves,
fell on a tiny box wedged in a sombre corner.
With a loud shout of joy, the Master Thief
recognized the spell-dispeller! It had fallen behind
a shelf and had lain there concealed for
almost twenty years! Thrusting it into his
pocket’s depth, the Master Thief bounded up
the secret stairs to the joy of the sun.</p>

<p>After a pleasant rambling journey in a huge
coach, the Master Thief and the invisible Prince
reached the city at the twilight hour, and took
lodgings at a quiet, comfortable inn. The invisible
Prince, I must remind you, was still
invisible.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that when supper had
been served and eaten, the Master Thief and the
invisible Prince went for a stroll through the
royal city. Much to the surprise of the travelers,
they found the city hung with streamers
and bunting of the gayest kind. Stranger still,
in spite of this display, the citizens of the royal
city appeared to be particularly out of spirits.</p>

<p>“Good host,” said the Master Thief to the
landlord of the inn, “pray what means this air
of jubilee? Do you make merry for some
kingly festival?”</p>

<p>“A festival, yes,” replied the host, looking
about to see if anyone were listening, “festival
it is, but only in name. Have you not heard
the news? Let us walk a little to one side and I
will tell you the story.</p>

<p>“Three years ago our gracious sovereign, the
good King Valdoro the Fourth&mdash;weary of the
cares of state and still stricken to the heart by
the loss of his son, the invisible Prince of whom
you may have heard&mdash;gave over the guidance
of the kingdom to the Marquis Malicorn. Last
week this official made himself master of the
royal power, imprisoned our dear King and
Queen in a dark tower, and proclaimed himself
successor to the throne. The coronation
is to be held to-morrow afternoon in the great
hall of the royal palace. Alas for the people
and the nation! Oh, if the invisible Prince
would only return!”</p>

<p>To this the Master Thief nodded his head,
his busy brain plotting all the while. All at
once he smiled. He had devised a plan.</p>

<p>And now it was once more the great hall of the
castle, and once more a sunny afternoon. Bells
rang, but their cry was wingless and leaden,
and there was a dull and joyless note in the cannon’s
roar. Crowded as densely together as ever
they were twenty years before, the magnificoes
sullenly awaited the arrival of the usurper and
his train.</p>

<p>Presently the portals were once more swept
apart, revealing Malicorn and his followers.
Not a sound rose from the assembly.</p>

<p>Growling for rage beneath a huge pair of
dragoon’s whiskers, the wicked Marquis made
his way to the dais and the coronation chair.
The noise of bells and cannon ceased. An official
in blue advanced with the royal robe.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to throw it over the
waiting shoulders of the usurper, an invisible
something snatched the robe from him and,
lo, it melted into the air!</p>

<p>Exceedingly angry, yet disturbed at heart,
Malicorn hoped for better luck with the sceptre,
but this, too, was snatched by an invisible
hand. As for the royal crown, it vanished from
its purple cushion in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>Speechless with rage, Malicorn now rose to
his feet, and stood before the throne, glaring
about into the air. Cries of defiance, mingled
with shouts of derision, rose from among the
magnificoes. And now, even as the turmoil was
at its height, the Master Thief, who had been
concealed behind some curtains, strode boldly
forth to the dais, thrust Malicorn aside with
a sweep of his long arms, and shouted to the
audience:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Magnificoes of the Realm, you came to see
your King. Your rightful King is here. Would
you behold him?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” shouted the assembly in one voice.
And now the Master Thief touched the invisible
Prince with the spell-dispeller.</p>

<p>The instant he did so a flash of deep golden
light set everyone blinking, fairy music was
heard, and suddenly the invisible Prince stood
visible before the throne. He was tall, dark-haired,
brown-eyed, and a bit slim, and the
crown was on his head, the robe on his shoulders,
and the sceptre in his hand.</p>

<p>And now the bells and cannon began to boom
in real earnest, and a gay breeze came sweeping
in to toss the flags and banners that had hung
so still. Overcome by emotion, the generalissimo
seized the Lord Chancellor by the waist
and swung him into a jig, the soldiers all tossed
their caps into the air and cheered like mad,
whilst the organist became so excited that he
began to play two tunes at once. Everybody
was laughing and hallooing and hurrahing.</p>

<p>As for Malicorn and his crew, they were
tumbling out the back door as fast as their
legs could carry them, and nobody has seen
them from that day to this.</p>

<p>Presently the old King and the Queen, released
from the dark tower, came hurrying in to
greet their son.</p>

<p>“He resembles you, my dear,” whispered the
King to the Queen.</p>

<p>The Master Thief was forgiven everything.</p>

<p>Singing and rejoicing, the people of the city
poured from the houses into the sunny streets.</p>

<p>Clang, clang! Boom! Clang, clang! Boom,
boom! Boom! Boom!</p>

<p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TWO_MILLERS">THE TWO MILLERS</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, in a pleasant country of
meadows sweeping seaward from wooded inland
heights, there were two millers and two mills.
If you came to the country in a ship, you saw
the windmill first, for it was built upon a
tongue of land rising above the wide salt
meadows and the washing midnight-tides;
but if you came to the country by the land, it
was the water mill you saw, for it stood beside
the highway in the valley of a brooklet rushing
to the sea.</p>

<p>Now the wind-miller, who was a great tall
man with blue eyes and fair hair, had a daughter
named Cecily, whilst the water-miller, who
was a little nimble man with a red face and
crisp, black curls, had a son named Valentine.
And because both the millers were merry
men, and there was a plenty of grain for both
the mills to grind, these millers were excellent
cronies, and the maiden Cecily had been betrothed
to the young man Valentine.</p>

<p>Every eve, when the day’s task at the water
mill had been brought to an end, the gates lowered,
and the brooklet turned free to rush
unhindered down the glen, Valentine would
walk from his wooded hills to the headland by
the sea, and call at the mill for Cecily. The
nights were often still, and the golden shield of
the moon, rising over the hilly woods, gleamed
upon the curling foam of the little long waves,
and filled their glassy hollows with her light.</p>

<p>Now it befell that as Valentine and Cecily
walked by the shore on such a night, they
heard from the hollow of the hills a faint and
far-off rumble like the echoing of thunder. Such
mysterious sounds were forever rising in the
hills, and because no one could tell whence they
came, a legend had grown up that somewhere
in the forest depths there dwelt a hidden someone,
known as the Husbandman of the Hills.</p>

<p>“Listen, Valentine,” said Cecily, “the Husbandman
of the Hills is closing the door of his
barn. Think you that some day a mortal may
find him in his hiding-place in the hills?”</p>

<p>“But suppose it were naught but an idle
tale?” said the merry youth, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh no, Valentine,” said the maiden seriously.
“All my life long have I dwelt here on the shore,
and heard the mysterious echoes from the hills.
Sometimes the sound is of the lowing of cattle,
sometimes of the threshing of grain, sometimes
’tis the creaking of a hay wain in a field. And
always the old and wise tell of the Husbandman
of the Hills. Some day a mortal will find the
hidden Husbandman&mdash;do you but wait and
see.”</p>

<p>It was the early summer now, and all went
merry as a marriage bell. The heavy water-wheel
turned with a rolling thunder and a
sound of endless splashing; and the four arms
of the windmill spun with a windy thrum and
a clock-like clack from the rising of the wind
to the calm of sundown and the eve.</p>

<p>And now, alas, events were at hand which
were to shatter the plans of the two millers and
wreck the hopes of Cecily and Valentine!</p>

<p>At the close of the harvest-tide, the Princess
Celestia, only daughter of the King and Queen
of the country, was going to be married. Now
it chanced that the Queen, her mother, was
famous in the land as a maker of cake, and
presently this good lady promised her daughter
a wedding cake so splendid and delicious that
painters would beg to be allowed to paint its
portrait, and poets to praise it in glorious and
immortal song.</p>

<p>Yes, the Queen would make the cake with
her own white hands, the batter should be
mixed in a golden bowl with a golden spoon,
the two best hens in the kingdom should be
summoned to lay the eggs, the oven should
have a door of diamonds, and as for the flour,
that should come from the finest fields and the
best mill in all the land.</p>

<p>“I know what I’ll do; I’ll offer a rich reward
for the best flour,” said the good Queen. And
calling the royal herald to her presence, she
bade him summon all good millers to strive
for the prize, and to bring of their new flour to
the palace at the close of the harvest yield.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the Queen’s herald, all
dressed in blue-and-white and sounding a silver
horn, came cantering first to the water-miller’s
door.</p>

<p>“I should like to win that treasure,” said the
water-miller to himself, musing in the doorway.</p>

<p>“After all, my flour <i>is</i> better than the wind-miller’s
meal. That treasure should be mine,
must be mine. Yes, mine, mine, mine!”</p>

<p>Now it was the custom of the country for
millers to visit the farms in midsummer, view
the growing, green grain, and bargain with the
husbandmen for the yield of the tossing fields.
Suddenly the water-miller, coveting the treasure,
determined to purchase all the standing
grain, so that the wind-miller should not have
any good grain to grind! And this he did,
forgetting the while that the deed was sharp
and unfriendly.</p>

<p>A day or two passed, and presently the wind-miller
climbed to the saddle of his fat white
steed, and rode away to buy his customary
grain. Alas, there was none to be had. Every
turn of the road disclosed new fields of grain,
but every single ear was pledged to the miller
by the brook!</p>

<p>At first&mdash;I must tell you&mdash;the wind-miller
was more hurt than angry at his old crony’s
trickery; but the more he thought of it the
angrier he grew. Storming about the windmill
in a rage, he gave a great roar for Cecily, and
when the frightened maiden appeared before
him, he bade her dismiss all thoughts of Valentine
from her heart, and consider herself fortunate
to be rid of the son of such a father.</p>

<p>The water-miller, however, was not to be outdone.
The moment he heard of the wind-miller’s
wrath, he too fell into a rage, and presently
forbade Valentine, on pain of dismissal,
so much as to look at the maiden Cecily.</p>

<p>And now the youth and the maiden were very
sad indeed, for in spite of the strife between
their fathers, they continued to love each other
very much. Presently Valentine could endure
it all no more, and stole away one night to
have a word with Cecily.</p>

<p>The mill brook was babbling in the dark when
Valentine returned to the mill, and a single
light was burning in a window by the door.
Opening the portal gently, the youth presently
discovered his father seated on the stair
clad in a flowered nightcap and a long white
dressing-gown.</p>

<p>“Valentine,” said the water-miller in a voice
deep as the bottom of a well, “where have you
been?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been to the windmill to see Cecily,”
said Valentine truthfully and bravely.</p>

<p>“Sirrah!” cried the water-miller, shaking
with such temper that his flowered nightcap
trembled on his head. “Did I not forbid you
to go to the windmill, on pain of being turned
away from this my house? Go!” And the
angry water-miller pointed a level finger out
into the night.</p>

<p>“But, father,” protested Valentine.</p>

<p>“But me no buts,” thundered the miller.
“Go, sirrah, for this house is yours no more.”</p>

<p>“But whither, father?” asked bewildered
Valentine.</p>

<p>“That, sirrah, is your affair,” replied the
angry miller. “Go anywhere you please; go
find the Husbandman of the Hills!”</p>

<p>And with this last bit of advice, the wrathful
water-miller pushed his son out of the mill and
drew the long, grinding bolt across the door.
A moment later the single light went out, and
the mill was dark.</p>

<p>And now Valentine, in search of shelter for the
night, sought out a farm in the gloom of the
wooded hills. Leaving the broad white road, he
followed first a country lane, then a pathway
winding through a great woodsy mire, and then
another lane, softly carpeted with moss and
last year’s fallen leaves.</p>

<p>A star fell from the twinkling heavens; a
hunting owl hooted in a tree. Ever so far
away a silver bell struck the midnight hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly Valentine knew that he had followed
a strange path, and was lost in the heart of the
hills. It was a very strange path indeed, for the
trees and the brambles along it seemed to have
grown together in the dark, and pressed forward
to form a thick imprisoning wall.</p>

<p>Uneasy at heart, the youth now turned to retrace
his steps, only to see that the same mysterious
trees had risen up behind!</p>

<p>Hours passed. Stars that were high in the
heavens vanished over treetops in the east, a
silvery dawn began to pale, and there were
chirps and stirs and peeps and feathery noises
in the wood. At the rising of the sun, Valentine
arrived at the farm of the Husbandman of
the Hills.</p>

<p>Now the Husbandman of the Hills&mdash;I must
tell you&mdash;was the farmer of the fairies. It was
from this farm in the hills that the goblins of
the mountain-tops, the elves of the silver river,
and the peoples of the fairy kingdoms of
the world had their apples and clotted cream,
their cherries and plums, and their butter-pats
stamped with a crown.</p>

<p>The fairy farm lay in a green vale, magically
walled about with briery trees. Only at the
midnight minute could the wall be passed, and
Valentine had chanced to cross it at the sixth
stroke of the bell.</p>

<p>And now Valentine found himself made welcome
by the Husbandman and his lady, the
Goodwife of the Hills. The Husbandman was
old; his face was ruddy and his hair silvery
white, and in a smock of blue with a white collar
was he clad. His spouse was elderly too, and
wore a gown of green with short old-fashioned
sleeves, a white housekeeper’s-apron, and a cap
with ribbons and frills.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you of how the long
summer passed at the farm of the fairies&mdash;of
the brewing, the baking, and the churning;
and of how the green elves came to cut the
grain with silver scythes no longer than your
arm; of how a very young giant, who had a
pleasant smile and was as tall as a tree, came
to pitch the hay into the barn; of how the
orchard goblins came to gather the wonderful
apples into baskets of silver and gold; and of
the enchanted bear who wore yellow spectacles
and turned the butter churn.</p>

<p>Presently the leaves, though green, began to
rustle dryly on the trees, and Valentine began
to long for his own again.</p>

<p>“You have been a faithful laborer,” said the
old Husbandman of the Hills. “A reward is
yours. What shall it be?”</p>

<p>“But I seek no reward,” said Valentine, “for
you gave me shelter, when shelter I had none.”</p>

<p>“A brave answer,” said the old Husbandman
with a smile. “But you have earned your wage,
good friend. I’ll give you <i>a wish</i>. Be in no
haste to use it. And guard it well!”</p>

<p>And now Valentine turned from the vale,
passed the magic bound at midnight, and found
himself once more in an old, familiar pathway
of the wood.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The autumn had been a rainless one, and the
water-miller was having forty fits.</p>

<p>The mill brook was running dry!</p>

<p>Already there was scarce water enough to stir
the heavy wheel. Another week without rain,
and the bed of the brook would be naught but
a length of puddles and pools. And the fine golden
grain he had purchased was being threshed
and winnowed, and would soon be arriving at
the mill!</p>

<p>In and out of the door of the mill, a hundred
times a day went the water-miller, now to stare
at the vanishing brook, now to sweep the sky
in hope of rain. But the dry leaves only rustled
more dryly, and the sun was bright.</p>

<p>Worse yet, the Princess Celestia’s wedding
day was fast approaching, and the Queen would
soon be calling for her flour. And sure enough,
the Queen’s herald presently rode again through
the land, summoning all good millers to bring
of their new flour to the palace before sundown
on the seventh day.</p>

<p>The following week was indeed an anxious
one for the miller by the brook. Alas for his
fortunes&mdash;not a single drop of rain fell either
in the meadows or the hills, and the brook ran
dry. You might as well have tried to turn the
wheel with a pitcher of water as to turn it with
the trickle which remained.</p>

<p>On the night of the sixth day, the water-miller,
humbled in heart, rode over to the windmill
to make his peace and ask a boon. He
would ask the wind-miller to grind the wonderful
golden grain, and offer him half of the grain
as a reward.</p>

<p>Now the wind-miller had not forgotten the
water-miller’s trickery; so he received his
old crony with anything but a friendly air.</p>

<p>“Grind grain for you, sir?” said the wind-miller,
standing with arms akimbo and feet
apart, “yes, sir; but only on one condition,
sir, and that is, sir, that you let me choose my
half of the grain, sir.</p>

<p>“And hearken, sir, one thing more, sir. You
must bring the grain to the windmill this very
night, sir.”</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as the water-miller,
hanging his head, went out into the night,
Cecily saw him, and ran to ask him for news
of Valentine. But the water-miller was himself
troubled because of the absence of his son, and
could give no new tidings to the maid.</p>

<p>Groaning many a regretful groan, the water-miller
loaded his fine two-wheeled scarlet cart
with sacks of golden grain, and carried it to the
windmill door. It was a warm night. The water-miller
unloaded the sacks, mopped his brow
with a red bandanna handkerchief, and sighed.</p>

<p>What a fool he had been not to play fair!
What a fool to send away his son!</p>

<p>When the water-miller had driven away, the
triumphant wind-miller took a great iron lantern,
and went down to see the grain. For a
moment or two he stood motionless, chuckling
at his unexpected victory. Presently he called
to Cecily to gather all the lights and candles
she could find, and place them round about.</p>

<p>And now, toiling in a great blaze of candlelight,
the wind-miller slowly and carefully sifted
out for himself the better half of the wonderful
grain. The remaining half&mdash;which was good
enough, but full of husks and dust&mdash;he set
apart for his rival.</p>

<p>The dawn was breaking as he finished the task.
Some of the candles were burned out, and the
lanterns were smoke-begrimed and dim. Wearily
rubbing the grain-dust from his eyes, the wind-miller
trudged up the circular stair and tumbled
into bed. He would grind the grain into
flour as soon as he woke in the morn.</p>

<p>And on that same still, autumn dawn young
Valentine came out of the fairy wood.</p>

<p>When the wind-miller woke, he woke with a
start, for he had slept late, and the sun was
high. How warm and misty-moisty it was!
Good heavens&mdash;there wasn’t a breath of
wind!</p>

<p>A ship drifted becalmed upon the glassy sea;
a blue haze of wavy summer heat lay upon the
meadows, and over the wooded hills hung a
motionless mass of bluish cloud with a rim of
silvery white. There was not even air enough to
stir a dead leaf hanging by a thread.</p>

<p>In and out of the door of the mill, like one
distracted ran the miller; he stood upon the
balcony and stared about at the sky, the greeny-leaden
sea, and the helpless ship; he lifted a
moistened finger to the air.</p>

<p>Oh, for a wind!</p>

<p>And now a ship’s bell in the mill struck the
eight strokes of high noon, and presently the
water-miller came hurrying to the mill in his
scarlet cart. A moment’s glance at the two
halves of golden grain told him of the wind-miller’s
counterstroke, and he ran upstairs into
the mill room full of wrath.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="millers" style="max-width: 28em;">

  <div class="caption"><p><i>He lifted a moistened finger to the air. Good heavens&mdash;there wasn’t
a breath of wind!</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>“I brought you my grain to grind,” he shouted
at the wind-miller, “and you have not done so.
I shall take it all back again, do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Wait; you made a bargain with me,” answered
the wind-miller.</p>

<p>“I tell you I am done with the bargain,” cried
out the water-miller in a passion.</p>

<p>“I tell you a bargain’s a bargain,” shouted
the wind-miller. “Touch yon grain if you dare!”</p>

<p>And now, I am sure, the old friends and cronies
would have come to blows, had not Valentine
and Cecily suddenly hurried and rushed between
them.</p>

<p>“Good sirs,” said honest Valentine, “pray
you stand apart and do each other no wrong.
The brook is dry; the wind is gone; of what use
then is this disputed grain? Were it not best,
mayhap, to begin anew?”</p>

<p>“Dear father,” said pretty Cecily, “Will you
give your share of the grain to me?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” said the wind-miller,
who hated brawling.</p>

<p>“And will you give your share to me, father?”
asked Valentine.</p>

<p>“Yes, and gladly,” said the water-miller.</p>

<p>“Heart’s thanks to you both, good sirs,”
said the youth with a bow and the maid with a
courtesy. “And now,” continued Valentine,
“you shall all behold a great wonder.</p>

<p>“O Husbandman of the Hills, you gave me
a wish for a wage. Grant it to me now! I wish
for a fine windmill-wind to blow till sundown
of this day.”</p>

<p>Out of the hills came the wind. It swept up an
inland dust, it sent the leaves on the higher
crests a-flying, it rushed over the hot sea-scented
meadows, it surged about the mill&mdash;and
the great arms gathered it, creaked,
groaned, and began a-spinning.</p>

<p>Valentine poured a shower of grain down an
oaken slide into the grinding thunder of the
heavy stones. The grain fell between the upper
and the nether wheel, and presently the finest
of new flour was pouring down below. And this
new flour the three millers shook and sifted
and cleansed until it was worthy of the Queen’s
own hands, the golden batter-bowl, and the
Princess Celestia’s cake. So wonderful indeed
was the flour, that it instantly gained the rich
reward the Queen had offered as a prize, and
won for Valentine the appointment of miller
to the King.</p>

<p>Touched by the happiness of their children,
I am glad to say, the two millers agreed to forget
their strife. And they shook hands, and became
cronies again.</p>

<p>On the day following the wedding of the Princess
Celestia, Valentine and Cecily were married.
The little Princess sent them two thick slices of
her cake. It was as white as snow, and frosted
with sugar, and there were candied plums, and
cherries, and citron nibbles in each slice.</p>

<p>And Valentine and Cecily rejoiced, and lived
happily together all their days.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ADAMANT_DOOR">THE ADAMANT DOOR</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, on a fine spring morning,
a country lad named Hugh took his fish pole
from a corner and went to try his luck in a
brook beside the road. Now it fortuned that
as he stood upon the grassy bank, casting
about in the broad shallows of the stream, the
boy heard the mighty sound of many men singing
together, and presently he beheld a regiment
of soldiers on the march. In uniforms of
red-and-white they were clad, and an officer in
red-and-white and gold was riding at their
head.</p>

<p>And now the regiment came to a halt, and
broke ranks beside the brook. With shouts
and cries the young soldiers hurried to the
water, opened their gay coats at the throat,
and washed the dust from their sunburnt faces;
the sergeants gathered and gossiped by themselves;
the horse of the guiding officer sucked up
great mouths of water, looked about, and blew
the spray from his nostrils; and here and there
a man helped a comrade with his pack.</p>

<p>“How splendid it must be to be a soldier!”
thought Hugh as he gazed upon the merry
company. And, hurrying home to his mother
as fast as his legs could carry him, he begged
so eagerly for permission to enlist, that at
length he won her consent and followed the
marching men.</p>

<p>And now the lad Hugh was himself a soldier
of the realm with a red-and-white uniform like
unto the others, a pack for his back, and a
shiny leather hat with a shiny silver star. Soon
he knew what it was to lie upon the ground
and shiver in a blanket, and to watch the rolling
stars, and hear the night wind cry.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that there was another young
soldier of Hugh’s age enlisted in the company,
and with this lad, whose name was Jocelyn,
Hugh presently became the best of friends.
This Jocelyn was a mountaineer and was slender
and yellow-haired; whilst Hugh was a lad of
the plain and was sturdy of frame and dark.
And because these two lads were the youngest
of the company and were loyal friends, they
marched down the highway side by side and
shared together the good and ill of life.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass upon a summer’s night,
as the soldiers lay encamped in fields by the
royal city, that the great bell of the King’s
palace broke the quiet of the stars with a loud
and unending clangor of alarm. It was late,
the watch fires had almost burned away, and
the soldiers, waking in the dark, seized upon
their arms and wondered at the din. All at
once, with a thunder of hoofs, a messenger from
the city came spurring in with the news that
war was at hand, and that the regiment must
break camp on the instant and speed to the
borders of the realm. Presently fresh branches
tossed upon the embers filled the camp with
the light of flames, and bugle calls rang through
the tumult and the clanging of the bell.</p>

<p>Left! Right! Left! Right! And the soldiers
were marching to the wars. They came to
ancient hamlets in the night, and found soldiers
of other companies already sleeping in the
barns; they marched through lonely forests,
and warmed their noonday meal with a blaze
of twigs and fallen boughs; they marched singing
through the fields of golden grain. Soon
the villages and the fields grew rare, a silence
fell upon the land, and the regiment found itself
at the edge of a vast and lonely moor. Regiments
without number were there encamped,
and their bivouac fires gleamed at night like a
thousand scattered stars.</p>

<p>Leagues away, on barren hills rising to the
north, were to be seen the fires of the foe.</p>

<p>And now it was the morn of battle: a red sun
was rising above the brown hills and hollows
of the moor, the air was sluggish, and flat gray
clouds lay motionless and low. Tarantara!
Tarantara! went the bugles, regiment after
regiment came marching to its post, the plain
shook to the tramp of feet, the horsemen gathered
behind, the drums began to sound, the
men in red-and-white marched down to the
moor, and presently the great hollow of the
waste rang like a brazen cup with the beginning
tumult of the fray.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the enemy were clad in black-and-white,
and wore shiny leather hats with
shiny golden stars.</p>

<p>The young comrades marched into battle side
by side. And even as a branch, thrust gently
from the bank of a racing river, first moves
slowly in calm waters by the edge of the stream
and then is caught up and tossed about by the
wild mid-torrent, so did the great tide of the
battle catch up Jocelyn and Hugh. They fought
as in a dream, scarce knowing what they did.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, at the storming of
a grassy hillock of the moor, Hugh was taken
prisoner by the men in black-and-white, but
was bravely rescued by Jocelyn who fought
his way undaunted to his side. Presently the
enemy yielded the disputed hill, and the company
in red-and-white made ready to hold it
for their own.</p>

<p>The day waned; a tide of dark and threatening
cloud rose over the horizon to the east, and a
cold wind rode before it, bringing rain. All at
once a wild and terrible storm burst over the
battle on the moor; and, under cover of the
thunder and confusion, the men in black-and-white
strove to regain the hillock for their own.
A bellowing wind whipped the heavy rain in
the soldiers’ eyes, and it was very hard to see.</p>

<p>Now it fortuned that, in the dark of the storm
and the tumult of the fray, the boy Hugh became
separated from his comrades and suddenly
found himself out of the battle, and wandering
quite alone. Night was rushing on, the
din of the combat was muffled in the roaring
of the rain, and the young soldier scarce knew
where to go.</p>

<p>Now it was his duty to return to the battle,
seek out his comrades, and fight beside them
to the end. Alas, so weary and shaken was
the soldier lad that he made no effort to return
to his hard-pressed friends, but fled away
from the battle through the dark! Presently
the all but roofless ruin of a shepherd’s hut
appeared ahead, and Hugh took refuge within
it from the battle and the storm.</p>

<p>All night long he lay there on the stones of
the floor, sunken in a shivering sleep; but the
dawn woke him at last, and he crept to a window
to look forth upon the moor.</p>

<p>All was still. The battle was lost. The men
in black-and-white were encamped upon the
nearer hillocks of the moor, and a company of
their horse was guarding a square of some hundred
men in white-and-red.</p>

<p>Suddenly the runaway soldier heard the
beat of a distant drum and, gazing through
a cranny of the ruined house, beheld a number
of prisoners marching by, forlorn. A triumphant
dragoon in black-and-white was riding
at their head; the drummer of his own company
followed close behind, mournfully beating his
drum; and then, trudging wearily on, appeared
the good comrades whom he had deserted in
their need. And Jocelyn walked among them
bareheaded, with his arms tied behind him at
the wrist.</p>

<p>And now the dark waters of sorrow and shame
welled up in the heart of the runaway soldier,
and he wept bitterly that he had failed to return
into the fray. He would have leaped from the
house and taken his place with his comrades,
save that he could not bear that they should
know of his flight.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, when the drum-beats
had faded into the silence of the moor, that
Hugh discovered a shepherd’s smock and wide-brimmed
hat hanging on a peg, and abandoned
his uniform for these. Thus clad, he fled from
the hut in the dead of night and made his escape
across the moor. Because of the triumph
of the enemy, he dared not return into his own
land, but fled to a kingdom in the west.</p>

<p>Presently he came upon a village lying at the
foot of a hill crowned with a ruined tower, and
there took service in the harvest fields.</p>

<p>As for Jocelyn and his comrades, they were
marched into the enemy’s country, thrust into
dungeons, and held for ransom, one and all.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now it fortuned that one noontide, as Hugh
rested with fellow laborers in the greenwood
shade, he asked them of the ruined castle on
the hill.</p>

<p>“Yon castle,” said a big harvester with an
important air, “was built centuries ago by an
old knight who was known throughout the
land as a magician. A treasure lies hid within,
but none dare seek it; for those who do&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never come back!” croaked another harvester,
a little lean man with thin legs and large
red ears.</p>

<p>“Once there was a brave adventurer who went
to seek the treasure,” said a man with long,
uncut, locks and a pointed nose. “We watched
him climb the hill, we saw him enter the castle,
and all at once we heard&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A terrible yell!” said the big harvester and
the red-eared man together.</p>

<p>“And he never came back,” said somebody
else, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“Bless us,” cried Hugh, “but what do you
suppose it is that guards the treasure?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ask me, I’ll tell you,” said the
big harvester; “it’s a trigorgon.”</p>

<p>“A trigorgon?” questioned Hugh. “And pray,
sir, what is a trigorgon?”</p>

<p>“A trigorgon is a creature that has only three
legs,” continued the big harvester. “It’s triangular
and flattish, the one leg being at the
front under the long neck, the two legs riding
behind. Short, thick, elephant-like legs, body
like a turtle, double rows of teeth, violent disposition.
I’ve read of it in a book.”</p>

<p>“Bother your book,” cried red-ears. “The
trigorgon you describe, my good sir, is quite
impossible. A trigorgon has its two legs in
front, and its one leg behind. A neck has got
to have shoulders to rest on, hasn’t it?
You see, young man, the trigorgon uses its
one hind leg to push itself ahead at a frightful
speed. I know!”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked the big harvester
with some displeasure.</p>

<p>“Because the seventh son of a seventh son’s
great-grandmother told me!” exclaimed red-ears
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Bother your seventh son’s great-grandmother!”
shouted the big harvester. “Now,
my book had large print and most wonderful
pictures!”</p>

<p>“Pish!” said red-ears.</p>

<p>“Tush for you and your seventh son of a
seventh son’s great-gran&mdash;”</p>

<p>“My friends! My friends!” interposed
pointed-nose. “Why quarrel over this absurd
trigorgon? You are both wrong. The castle is
haunted by a thith, a terribly dangerous thith.
All over the land they say it’s a thith.”</p>

<p>“Who say?” questioned the big harvester.</p>

<p>“They say,” replied pointed-nose.</p>

<p>“Bother they, and all they say,” shouted the
big harvester, forgetting his grammar. “It’s
a trigorgon!”</p>

<p>“It’s a thith!” shrieked pointed-nose.</p>

<p>And now began a tremendous uproar in
which everybody took part, some agreeing with
the big harvester, some with red-ears, and some
with pointed-nose. A few who disbelieved in
both the trigorgon and the thith stood disdainfully
to one side, but suddenly they too
began to quarrel violently among themselves
as to whether the castle was haunted by a
mistophant, a winged bogus, a bristly whiskeroarer
or an ugsome vrish. So bitter grew the
strife that presently red-ears and pointed-nose
fell to fisticuffs and were separated with great
difficulty by their fellow-harvesters.</p>

<p>“A treasure!” said Hugh to himself. “Ah, if I
could but find it, I would ransom Jocelyn and
the comrades.” And with an uneasy heart, he
thought of the trigorgon, the thith, the winged
bogus, the snarling whiskeroarer, the mistophant,
and the vrish.</p>

<p>How terrible it would be to meet creatures so
awful that no human being had dared to see
them! But Jocelyn and the comrades whom he
had failed in their hour of peril on the moor,
what of them? They were prisoners in the land
of the foe; with the treasure of the castle he
could ransom them&mdash;was he to fail them
again?</p>

<p>All at once the runaway young soldier threw
back his shoulders bravely and lifted his eyes
to the sky. He would seek the treasure on the
morrow’s morn.</p>

<p>The sun was shining brightly, a cold dew was
still glistening on the leaves, and the villagers
had gathered by the public well to speed Hugh
on his way. Shaking their heads doubtfully
and mournfully, they watched him go swinging
down the road and disappear into the trees
upon the hill. Presently the glint of his blue
smock began to be seen here and there along the
climbing path, close by the summit of the
mount. A little anxious time passed, and suddenly
there rang from the ruin a long, wild
howl.</p>

<p>“There, the trigorgon has got him,” said the
big harvester.</p>

<p>“You mean the giant thith,” pointed-nose
corrected.</p>

<p>I am glad to tell you, however, that they were
both wrong. This is what had happened at
the ruin.</p>

<p>Now Hugh had carried an ancient lantern
with him from the village, and halfway up the
hill he paused, cut a likely branch from an ash,
and fashioned himself a stout and serviceable
staff. Thus armed, he arrived at the great gate
of the ruin, and forced his way through the
thorn trees by the portal into the roofless
square of the walls. There were trees there, too,
and though the leaves were still green, every
now and then one went drifting through the
silence to the ground. In the heart of the
wooded court, a broad flight of steps, overgrown
with moss and shrubs of shallow root,
led down into a darkness far below.</p>

<p>Grasping his cudgel firmly, Hugh descended
the woodsy stair. The sunlight disappeared
behind, the green moss grew no more, and
clumps of leathery toadstools burst from the
muddy crannies of the stone. Suddenly the
runaway soldier found himself facing a giant
pointed door of blackest adamant. Over the
arch of it, in letters of ancient form, was carved
a legend saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="antiqua">He who would share the treasure</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><span class="antiqua">must conquer a mighty foe within</span></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Behind the door something was roaring and
roaring. “’Tis surely the trigorgon,” thought
Hugh, his heart pounding at his ribs. Summoning
up all his courage, the runaway soldier
threw back the adamant door.</p>

<p>The instant he did so, the roaring rose to a
howling shriek, and a gust of the storm wind,
magically imprisoned in the caves of the hill,
went whistling out of the adamant door and up
the tunnel of the stairway to the sun. It was
this cry of the imprisoned gust which had made
them shake their heads in the village below.</p>

<p>And now Hugh bravely set foot into the
darkness and, holding his twinkling light at
arm’s length ahead, advanced to meet the
mighty foe within. Through great halls he
fared, and heard queer noises which he took to
be the steps of the trigorgon, but were only the
echoes of his own steps tapping in the dark;
through long tunnels he trod, and heard breathings
and whispers which he took to be the
sighs of the thith, but were only the echoes of a
chuckling brook, flowing somewhere in the
wall. On and on went Hugh, and laughed a
little to himself when he mistook two shining
points of stone for the eyes of the winged
bogus, and a monstrous round rock for the
bulk of the mistophant.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="door" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/door.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>Summoning up all his courage, Hugh threw open the adamant door</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>After a while, I am glad to tell you, he even
ceased turning around now and then to see if
he were being followed by the whiskeroarer or
the vrish.</p>

<p>Presently Hugh began to hear the queerest
tinkling-clinking ringing sound, unbroken in
its flow as the trilling of a stream. A moment
later the youth opened a second pointed door
and stood in a lighted chamber, staring at a
<i>fountain of money</i>.</p>

<p>The chamber was high and square; its roof
and walls were of blackest adamant, twinkly-bright
with specks of yellow gold, and a
magic, ever-burning lamp of adamant hung
from above, yielding a golden light. In the
height of the further wall a great fountain-like
opening there was, framed in a golden star, and
through this there poured a ringing cataract of
coins of yellow gold! Below the shower of
money, a semicircular basin, raised above the
floor on pillars strangely carved, received the
golden flood and lay full to the brim of clinking
pieces of gold rising, falling, tossing, and washing
about like waters in a pool. About the brim
of the fountain there ran a sculptured band of
stone whereon men were shown engaged in
honorable labor&mdash;the farmer scattered the
seed, the harvester gathered the grain, the
smith labored at his forge, and a master workman
carved a fair statue from a block of faultless
stone.</p>

<p>And Hugh, pausing to look at the pieces of
gold, saw that they were of ancient years and
sealed with the seal of old, forgotten kings.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, when Hugh had
filled his pockets and his hat with gold, he discovered
a third adamant door leading from the
chamber and, passing through it, found himself
blinking in the sunlight on the further
side of the hill. Strange to say, in the wall of
stone behind him there was never a sign or appearance
of a door!</p>

<p>But the mighty foe within&mdash;what could it be?
He had seen nothing of the trigorgon, the
thith, the winged bogus, the whiskeroarer, the
mistophant, or the vrish. Yet the inscription
had said that he must conquer a foe. Suddenly
Hugh threw his hands into the air with a great
merry shout; he had found the key to the
mystery.</p>

<p>It was all a wise jest of the old knight. The
foe to be conquered was fear, and “the mighty
foe within” meant the host of silly fears which
run and hide in the house of one’s heart. The
treasure had been guarded against men by
their own fears. Brave men, who sent fears
hurrying and scurrying out of their hearts,
alone were worthy of the prize.</p>

<p>As for the trigorgon, the thith, the winged
bogus, the whiskeroarer, the mistophant, and
the ugsome vrish, they had never existed, for
they were not creatures, but silly, thoughtless
imaginings and fears.</p>

<p>And now Hugh, with his pockets laden with
gold, walked over the hills to the enemy’s land,
and ransomed his comrade Jocelyn and the
dear friends with whom he had marched to
battle on the moor.</p>

<p>Presently a just and mighty emperor compelled
both kingdoms to make peace, and the
men in red-and-white and the men in black-and-white
went home to their fields and their dear
ones gathered by the fire.</p>

<p>And Hugh and Jocelyn shared the treasure
together, and their farms lay side by side.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CITY_OF_THE">THE CITY OF THE
WINTER SLEEP</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, by the banks of a noble
river flowing to the sea through a mountain-girdled
plain, stood a city of the wisest people
in the world. Instead of spending the winter as
others did, huddled over smoky fires, freezing
ears and noses, bundling themselves up in a
pother of clothes, and being cross at breakfast,
these sensible folk simply retired to their dwellings,
locked their doors, drew down their curtains,
put on their nightcaps, got into bed,
and <i>slept the winter away</i>. The north wind
howled there about the shuttered houses and
woke no citizen from his dreams; in the empty
market place and the silent streets, stainless
and untrodden lay the snow. But when the
leaves were the size of a mouse’s ear, and the
singing birds had returned from their winter
pilgrimage, the sleepy citizens would wake, rub
their eyes, stretch their arms, and come yawning
to open their windows on the sunlight and
the spring.</p>

<p>The King of this remarkable city, I must tell
you, had three children, the two elder of whom
were sons and the youngest a daughter. Now,
as occasionally happens, the two sons were
models of royal deportment, whilst their sister,
the slender, dark-haired, and dark-eyed Princess
Theolette, was as wilful and spirited as a
mountain bird.</p>

<p>Now, on a day when the year was growing old
and only a few half-withered flowers were to
be gathered in the fields, it chanced that Theolette,
who had been idling about with little
to do, took it into her head to pay a visit to the
royal library. It was very quiet there, the red
autumn sun was shining through the great
windows, a million motes of dust danced in the
broad and ruddy beam, and Theolette, curled
in a huge red-leather easy-chair, had great difficulty
in keeping awake. Presently her eyes lit
upon a large green book entitled, <i>Winter Time</i>,
and this Theolette took from its place and
opened in her lap.</p>

<p>Somewhat to her disappointment, the print
within the old book was in a foreign language,
but the pictures&mdash;they would have
kept anyone from sleeping! There were pictures
of snowy mountain-tops, of bright,
frozen lakes with people skating on them, of
attacks on snow forts, of snowstorms in pleasant
country villages, and of belfries agleam with
snow beneath the moon. Now, although Theolette
had never seen the winter or any snow or
ice and could hardly make anything out of
some of the pictures, she could see well enough
that here was something strange, and new, and
wonderful indeed. And then and there she resolved
to run away during the winter sleep, see
the winter world, and return before the city
woke to the coming of the spring!</p>

<p>Shorter grew the golden days, and longer the
still cold nights, and presently the great day
of the winter sleep was at hand. A trumpeter,
posted in the tower of dreams, at sunrise called
the city to its last morn of waking life; and
scarce had his last notes faded, ere a murmur of
bustle and preparations began to rise from every
household in the town.</p>

<p>At sunset, in accordance with ancient custom,
the edict of sleep was read to the people from a
balcony of the palace. This venerable law, I
must tell you, summoned all good citizens to go
to sleep, and recited the dreadful penalties
prepared for all who should dare to stay awake.
When the gathering had melted away, and the
streets were empty save for a hurrying citizen
or two on some belated errand, the gates were
locked and the waters of the river turned into
the moat about the town.</p>

<p>The enchanted chimes of sleep, which rang of
themselves, were to sound at the midnight
hour.</p>

<p>Little by little, the royal palace became as
silent as a stone. A darkness of slumber and
night filled the vast echoing halls, and from
afar through the gloom came the faint tramp,
tramp of the hob-nailed night-watch on the
last round of the year.</p>

<p>After attending the ceremonial winter good-night
of the royal family, Theolette hurried
away to her own chamber.</p>

<p>“I mustn’t fall asleep now,” said she, clenching
her fist, “because if I do, I’ll sleep until the
spring!” And with a heart that went thump,
thump, thump in the darkness, she waited the
midnight hour.</p>

<p>Suddenly the first warning bell&mdash;<i>Nightcaps
On!</i>&mdash;struck one great solemn rolling clang
which swept out over the city and ebbed away
humming to the stars.</p>

<p>And now, after a pause, sounded the second
bell&mdash;<i>Lights out!</i> Theolette sat down in a
great chair, arose, walked about, sat down
again, and arose once more. Would the third
bell never ring?</p>

<p>Presently&mdash;<i>Everybody to bed!</i>&mdash;boomed the
third bell. Theolette put her fingers to her
ears. Solemn and sweet and strange and golden,
the enchanted chimes were sounding their
fairy tune.</p>

<p>Now, once the song of the chimes had come to
an end and the throbbing humming of the last
grave chord had melted into the air, Theolette
went to her window, drew back the curtain, and
looked forth over the city sleeping in the starlight.
How strange and still they were, those
dark streets winding like crooked brooks
through banks of huddled roofs. Suddenly
the Princess uttered a little cry of surprise!</p>

<p>Far away across the sleeping city, in a little
house by the wall, a yellow light was gleaming!
And now the light moved, went from window
to window, vanished, reappeared, and vanished
yet again.</p>

<p>Someone else was awake in the city! Who
could it be?</p>

<p>Puzzled, but not the littlest bit afraid, the
Princess went to her wardrobe and dressed
herself as well as she could in a little red hunting-dress
and cap. Then, throwing her warmest
mantle over her shoulders and taking a lighted
candle with her, she made her way from her
chamber down the great stairway to the palace
door. Fantastic shadows leaped and swayed
as the Princess, holding aloft her taper, descended
the long broad flight, and somewhere
a huge clock ticked on, solemn, dutiful, and
forgotten. Opening the door gently, Theolette
stepped forth into the dark street and hurried
along it to the royal gate of the city wall.</p>

<p>All seemed well; the gates were locked, and the
drawbridge of the moat was lifted high above
the black and starry waters. Standing motionless
for a moment in one of the shadowy nooks
of the giant portal, Theolette listened for a
footfall or a sound, but heard only the sigh of
the night wind and the ripple of water in the
moat. Reassured by the silence, the Princess
lowered the drawbridge, unlocked the great
gate with her father’s own key, opened one vast
swinging door, locked it behind her, and walked
off bravely into the dark and lonely land.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="sleep" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/sleep.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>The runaway Princess stepped forth into the dark street and,
taper in hand, hurried to the gate of the city wall</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>On the following morning, a little after the
dawn, the Princess arrived at a country town
just over the frontier of her father’s realm, and
there she sought out the inn and made preparations
for her runaway winter-pilgrimage. From
the host, a little white horse she purchased, and
from the host’s fourth son, who happened to be
a tailor, a fine warm riding-habit of country
wool. Thus clad, away into the winter world
galloped the adventurous Theolette. Of what
befell her, you soon shall hear.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And what a wonderful pilgrimage it was
through the world of ice and snow! I wish I
had time to tell you of all she saw and of all
she did, of how the first snowstorm so pleased
her that she almost lost her way in the whirl
of the flakes, of her first look at a bit of ice, of
her visit to the winter festival of the Fairy of
the Snows, of how she danced the minuet at the
polar bears’ ball, and of how she rode Aldebaran,
the skating horse, up and down the ice
lakes of the wild. White as snow was this marvelous
animal, and of blue leather edged with
white were his saddle and bridle, whilst the
skates he wore were of the blackest and shiniest
adamant. You should have seen him skating
o’er the lakes, now striking out with this hoof,
now with that; his head held high, his long
silky tail streaming in the wind. And Theolette
thought, as she rode, of the old book in the royal
library and of the City of the Winter Sleep far
away, with the storm crying unheeded through
its dream.</p>

<p>And now the winter waned, a venturesome
bird or two returned to rock on budding twigs,
the earth began to turn from brown to green,
and Theolette knew that she must hasten back
at once. Alas! one pleasant morning, as she
was nearing the borders of her father’s land, a
band of robbers suddenly sprang at her out
of a wood, bound her securely, and hurried her
to their castle with the intention of demanding
a ransom. Once there, they pushed the Princess
roughly into a little cobwebby turret-chamber,
slammed and locked the heavy oaken door behind
her, and left her to her thoughts.</p>

<p>From her window in the turret, Theolette
could see the highroad leading toward the
castle through the wooded lowlands, and the
broad winding stream of a mighty river&mdash;the
very river, indeed, which flowed by the walls
of the City of the Winter Sleep. With every
warm and sunny hour the spring was driving
old winter from the land, the scales of tree buds
were unsealing, frogs were piping in tiny triumph
from every marsh and pool, and there
were pleasant earthy smells in the air.</p>

<p>“The spring awakening is surely close at
hand,” thought Theolette. “What <i>shall</i> I do?”</p>

<p>Now, one sunny morning as the disconsolate
Princess walked to and fro in her little room, it
came to pass that she heard from the road below
a pleasant voice singing a strange old song of
her own land. It was a song about a soldier
who had fought in the wars and returned in the
spring to plough the dear earth he had loved
and defended. And, hearing the old song,
Theolette uttered a joyful cry and ran to the
window. A youth in a student’s dress of green
stood in the highroad directly under the window;
he had heard the cry, and stood looking
up at the sunny wall.</p>

<p>“Stay, good sir,” cried Theolette, “and tell
me who you are that sings a song of mine own
land.”</p>

<p>To this the pleasant youth replied that he
was but a student who had stolen away from
the City of Winter Sleep, and was even then
hastening back lest his absence be discovered.
And Theolette remembered the light she had
seen in the old house by the city wall.</p>

<p>And now Theolette told the student of her
adventures and begged of him to aid her. You
may be sure that the student, who was a fine
brave fellow, needed no second entreaty! Being
a clever youth as well as a brave one, he skillfully
managed to lure the robbers away from
the castle that very eve, and fling a coiled rope
to the Princess. And, hand over hand, with feet
pressed close against the cord, down came the
adventurous Theolette.</p>

<p>Now, one of the robbers, a small one, had
ridden away with Theolette’s little white horse,
so the student hurried Theolette to the river
bank where a boat lay waiting. Alas, the vessel
was scarce large enough for a single passenger!</p>

<p>“See, Princess, the river is in flood,” said the
youth, “and you have but to step into this
vessel and be carried swiftly to the city.”</p>

<p>“But what of you, brave friend?” said Theolette.
“You will be late now, and your flight
from the city will be known.”</p>

<p>“Do not fear, Princess,” replied the student
with a queer, half-merry smile. “There is still
time, and I can make haste as well as any
man. To tell you truth, I have never felt at
home in the city, anyway. But enough of words.
Hasten, Lady Theolette, for the robbers will
soon return.”</p>

<p>And now Theolette found herself on the mighty
river in the full hurly-burly of its springtide
flood. On and on she swept through the night,
league after league, now floating quietly over
lowlands turned to lakes; now borne headlong
with the torrent down valleys and ravines.
Solitary and fugitive, one great star shone close
above the distant peaks.</p>

<p>Just as the dawn was streaking the east with
rose and gray, the Princess gained her father’s
city. The drawbridge was still lowered across
the moat, the city was still sealed in its winter
dream.</p>

<p>After thrusting the little boat once more forth
into the full current of the river, Theolette ran
to the palace and went to her own room. With
a little sigh, she folded away the worn red
hunting-dress and cap she had been wearing&mdash;the
riding-habit of country wool had been left
behind somewhere at the return of spring&mdash;and
crept into her little silken bed. So weary
was she that scarce had her head touched the
pillow ere she was sound asleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When she opened her eyes again, a whole day
and a night had passed, the City had risen
from the winter sleep, and her mother stood
bending over her with an amused smile. Loud
and clear and joyous the silver bells of the
spring-awakening were ringing o’er the town.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Theolette,” said her mother,
“but what a sleeper you are! I’ve been shaking
you for the last ten minutes. Get up now,
that’s a dear, and wear your rose frock to the
grand spring breakfast.”</p>

<p>A little later Theolette, feeling just the tiniest
bit bewildered, sat down to breakfast with her
father the King, her mother the Queen, and the
two Princes her brothers. And there, moved by
an impulse of truth and courage&mdash;for, though
wilful, Theolette was as faithful to high honor
as a vowed knight&mdash;the Princess told them all
the tale of her runaway adventures. To her
surprise, she could win none of them to believe
her story!</p>

<p>“You have been dreaming, Theolette,” said
her father, gravely shaking his head and reaching
for a royal muffin. “But I called you myself!”
exclaimed her mother, pausing from her
royal marmalade. And as for Theolette’s two
brothers, they pretended that polite disbelief
which young men find so delightfully irritating
when teasing their sisters.</p>

<p>Weeks passed, spring followed winter into
the cupboard of time, and Theolette could find
no one to believe her story. Weary of insisting,
and shaken by the unbelief of those about her,
the Princess began to wonder in her own heart
if it were not all a dream. Nothing remained of
it all, and it was so like a dream!</p>

<p>Her head bowed low, her eyes full of doubt and
memories, the Princess mused all day, and
finally grew so pale that her royal parents became
quite alarmed, and took counsel to send
their daughter on a long visit to her aunt, the
Queen of the Golden Mountain. On the morn
of departure, Theolette walked to the great hall
of state to say farewell.</p>

<p>“A dream, a dream; was it only a dream?”
thought Theolette. And she saw again the
winter world, and the polar bears’ ball, with
the candles burning in chandeliers of icicles,
and the skating horse, and the pleasant youth
in green who had saved her from the robbers.
Could it have been only a dream? With a sigh
and a doubting shake of her head, the Princess
took her place at the head of her ladies
and approached her father and mother.</p>

<p>And now, of a sudden, from the sunny street
below the pillared window, a voice was heard
singing. And the voice sang an old song of
a soldier who had fought in the wars and returned
in the spring to plough the dear earth
he had loved and defended. A hush fell over
the astounded assembly.</p>

<p>“Stop, I pray you!” cried Theolette, turning
pale as the new-fallen snow. “O hasten, good
soldiers, and bring yon singer here before me!”</p>

<p>And now a group of guards rushed through the
swinging doors to do her bidding. Presently
they returned, bringing with them the student
who had saved Theolette from the robbers!
He was very pale, there were irons on his wrists,
and two burly turnkeys, dressed in red and
black, stood beside him. And, beholding Theolette,
the poor youth drew in his breath with a
start and met her gaze with strange eyes.</p>

<p>“Speak! What does this mean? Who is this
fellow?” cried the King, rising from his throne.</p>

<p>“May it please Your Majesty,” replied a
turnkey, falling on one knee, “this youth is
a student of the College of Dreams who disobeyed
the edict of sleep and ran away from the
city. He was captured as he tried to return after
the spring awakening, brought before the Court
of Dreams, and sentenced to pay the penalty.
We were on our way with him to the dungeons
under the river when the royal guards
surrounded us and led us here. What is your
will, O King?”</p>

<p>“My will is that the judgment be obeyed,”
replied the King. “Lead him forth to his
doom!”</p>

<p>“Nay, hear me, father,” cried Theolette. “If
he is guilty, so am I! I, too, disobeyed the
edict; I, too, ran away. This is the brave youth
who so gallantly preserved me from the robbers!
Oh, will you not believe me now? It is
not a dream&mdash;it never was a dream!”</p>

<p>At these words, a stir of excitement swept
through the vast hall; indeed, it seemed as if all
there were trying to talk, to protest, to support,
to dispute, to explain. The uproar was at its
height when the boom of a cannon first quieted,
then roused the hubbub to an even greater
pitch.</p>

<p>“A royal visitor!” exclaimed the King. “What
can this mean? Let no one stir!”</p>

<p>Presently, there was a fanfare of many trumpets,
the great portals of the hall swung open,
and there entered a crowned King and his train.</p>

<p>“O King of the City of the Winter Sleep,”
cried the newcomer, “hear me, for I have come
from afar and in great haste. I am the King
of the North and I seek my only son, Prince
Florimond, who was stolen from his cradle
twenty years ago. The Fairy of the Isles has revealed
that I shall find him here. He dwells in
a house by the city wall and is a student of the
College of Dreams. I pray you search for him
at once, for my heart hungers to behold him!”</p>

<p>“Florimond? Florimond?” cried the Lord
Chancellor of the College, stepping forward,
“there is but one Florimond in the city and,
as I live, this youth is he!” And presently all
beheld that the great King and the runaway
student were indeed father and son. To pardon
the runaway youth and loose him from his
bonds was but a moment’s task. This done, a
royal herald proclaimed a three days’ holiday.</p>

<p>On the last evening of the festival, Florimond
and Theolette walked alone to a great balcony
and looked forth over the city, the river, and
the mountain-circled plain. It was midsummer
eve, the warm night was sweet with the fragrance
of many flowers, and the music of lutes
and viols sounded faintly through the pleasant
air.</p>

<p>“Was it a wonder that I ran away,” said the
Prince, laughing, “when I wasn’t born a
winter sleeper?”</p>

<p>“The winter&mdash;ah, what fun it all was!”
answered Theolette. “I wonder if I shall ever
see it again.”</p>

<p>“You shall see it every year if you will only
consent to be Princess of the North,” replied
Florimond, with a gallant smile. And then
and there the two runaways pledged their troth.
The wedding over, Florimond returned to his
own land, taking Theolette with him; and,
unless you have heard to the contrary, they are
living there happily still.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AILEEL_AND_AILINDA">AILEEL AND AILINDA</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time a company of jugglers, acrobats,
and other strays, traveling afoot to the
Fair of the Golden Bear, arrived at twilight in
a glen close by a village and encamped there
for the night. From eventide till late into the
dark, the watchful villagers beheld their huge
fire blazing behind the dark columns of the
trees; but at dawn all was still, for the wanderers
had risen by the glow of the morning
star, and fared away toward the sea.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that an old villager, whose
lands lay beyond the glen, rose early that morn,
and with his hoe on his shoulder walked to
his labor through the sunrise, the quiet, and
the dew. Arriving at the glen, he turned
aside for a moment from the path and out of
curiosity wandered in to gaze at the trampled
grass and the burned circle of the fire. Suddenly
he caught his breath with a start. Two
little children, a boy in tattered leather and
a girl in a ragged frock of blue, were lying fast
asleep on a pile of yellow straw.</p>

<p>And now the two children stood, hand in
hand, in the house of the Master Villager,
gazing up into the faces of a dozen gathered
there to see them and to question. The little
boy, who was brown-haired and brown-eyed,
bore himself bravely and appeared sturdy and
strong, whilst the tiny girl, whose blue eyes
were full of frightened tears, seemed very gentle
and shy. Of who their parents were, and of
how it had fortuned that they had been thus
forsaken, neither the little boy nor the girl
could tell; indeed the most that could be gathered
from them was that they were not brother
and sister, and that the lad’s name was Aileel
and the girl’s, Ailinda.</p>

<p>Forlorn, forsaken, and unknown, the children
of the wanderers remained in the village and
were given to certain villagers to house and to
keep. It was the lot of Aileel to become the
foster son and little apprentice of Braulio, the
good smith, whilst tiny Ailinda fell into the
hands of Tharbis, the grudging and envious
miser of the town.</p>

<p>And now passed many years; and Aileel, of
whom you first must hear, grew to be a comely
young smith, wise in the lore of iron and of fire.
Tall was he, broad-shouldered and very strong,
yet so lithe and swift-moving withal that none
in his wide land of the Blue Hills could master
him in a trial of strength or speed. His favorite
pastime was country wrestling, and on holiday
morns you were sure to see him and his good
foster father wandering down the village lanes
to the day’s wrestling-match, each tricked out
in his best, each with a fine blue kerchief
knotted at the throat. And when Aileel, after
a stirring battle of catch and turn and tug and
strain would hold his rival’s shoulders to the
straw and then leap up, light as air, joyful
and victorious, how honest Braulio would
shout and pound together his huge hands!</p>

<p>Their smithy stood by the village brook; of
gray-green stone its walls were made, and its
roof of heart-of-oak turned silvery brown. It
was a brave sight, I can tell you, to see the fire
rising hot and violet-white from the forge,
brightening Aileel’s face as he bent to it and
gazed within it at the iron turning ruddy gold;
and there was a brave music, too, in the clang-clanging
of the anvil ’neath his blows.</p>

<p>Far otherwise, alas, were the fortunes of
Ailinda! Scolded to work at the earliest dawn
and kept at some task till well into the night,
the poor maiden had hardly a moment’s time
to call her own. Whenever he could and as
often, Aileel came to help her with her toil;
he drew water from the well, carried in the
wood, and aided her in the garden in the cool
of the golden day.</p>

<p>In spite of this hard life, I am glad to tell you,
Ailinda grew up to be as fine a lass as Aileel a
lad. Her eyes were as blue as the waters of the
bright September sea, the glance they gave was
full of patience and courage, her long golden
hair was as splendid as a queen’s. Everybody
loved her and helped her&mdash;all save Tharbis’s
only son, her jealous foster-brother, Potpan.</p>

<p>Squat, round-nosed, and leering-eyed, there
was no spiteful trick in all the world which
this wretch was not prepared to try. He would
slyly nip the buds from flowers Ailinda had
planted, so that they might not bloom; he
would drive the cows at twilight back into the
fields; he would roll the clean milk-pans in the
mire. Left to his own counsel, Aileel would
soon have taught the wretch a lasting lesson,
but as Ailinda feared lest after such a battle
Aileel be forbidden the house, she endured
much, saying naught.</p>

<p>But presently came matters to a head.</p>

<p>Now it chanced upon a May Day, that a fair
blue kerchief had been chosen as the wrestler’s
prize, and this prize Aileel won gallantly, and
offered to Ailinda. Gathering the kerchief together
again in the folds in which it had already
lain, the maiden, for fear of Potpan, hid the kerchief
in a cranny of a room. Presently arrived
the sunny morn of the year’s midsummer holiday.
At high noon, her thankless toil for a
moment o’er, Ailinda went to take the kerchief
from its nook.</p>

<p>The kerchief was no longer there!</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a loud ill-natured guffaw,
and turning, found Potpan at a window, watching
all. He was dressed in his best festival
finery, and Ailinda’s pretty kerchief was knotted
at his neck. The maiden’s heart sank; her
brave eyes filled with tears, yet she ran forth
and confronted the robber face to face.</p>

<p>“Give me my kerchief, Potpan,” said she,
“Oh, give me my kerchief, Potpan!”</p>

<p>“Your kerchief?” answered Potpan with
another rude guffaw. “Ha! Ha! That’s a
good one! Your kerchief, indeed! I found this
kerchief myself, and I mean to keep it, too.”</p>

<p>“It is mine, Potpan,” replied poor Ailinda.
“Give me my kerchief, Potpan.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you would wear it at the festival,”
jeered Potpan. “The notion of your going to
the festival! Go back to your kettles and
pails!”</p>

<p>A pause of quiet now followed, and all at once
Ailinda heard through the stillness the sound
of a closing gate. Suddenly Aileel came striding
swiftly to her side.</p>

<p>“Come, Potpan,” said Aileel sternly, “Give
Ailinda my kerchief!”</p>

<p>“At your command, you wanderers’ brat?”
cried Potpan, furious with rage. “Be off or
I’ll teach you how I&mdash;” but here his speech
came to an end; Aileel, turning swiftly as the
wind, caught him in a wrestler’s grasp, held
him fast, and undid the kerchief from his neck.
This done, the young smith freed him and
pushed him contemptuously aside. Hardly had
he done this, however, when Potpan caught up
a great stone and flung it, striking Aileel with it
upon the hand.</p>

<p>And now there came a real tussle, for Potpan,
though squat, was no mean antagonist. A real
tussle it was, but a short one, for suddenly
Aileel’s handsome face cleared, he laughed a
little merry laugh even, and catching up Potpan
in all his finery, held him high for all his kicking,
walked with him a little space, and tossed
him splash into the duck pond! You should
have heard the squawking and the quacking
of the ducks, and seen the scrambling, and the
paddling, and the indignant tail-feather-shaking
as Potpan fell into the mud-brown pool.
One yellow duckling with cold wet feet walked
on his ear.</p>

<p>But what an uproar awaited Aileel and Ailinda
on their return from the festival!</p>

<p>Telling a wicked and lying story, Tharbis and
Potpan had gone about among the villagers,
picturing Aileel as a violent and dangerous
ruffian whom it was unsafe to have about, and
urging that the wanderers’ lad be sent away
from the village. Now Tharbis was very rich,
and there were many in his debt who dared not
disagree with him; a dispute arose, the village
took sides, and the partisans of Tharbis and
Potpan snatched the victory. At the head of
a crew of hangers-on armed with sticks and
scythes, Tharbis and Potpan came in triumph
to the smithy, held Braulio and his foster son
to the wall, and bade the latter leave the village
at once, never to return.</p>

<p>“I go, Potpan,” replied Aileel, the same strange
little smile on his lips, “but I shall return some
day, and I shall toss you into the duck pond
once again.”</p>

<p>“Enough! Be off, wanderers’ brat!” cried
Potpan’s crew. “Begone, and never let us see
your face again!”</p>

<p>So now Aileel bade his dear foster-father farewell,
entrusted Ailinda to his care, and fared
over hill, over dale, to the Kingdom of Iron in
the Land of the Fiery Mountains.</p>

<p>When Aileel arrived there, it was twilight; the
east behind him was already dark and blossoming
with stars, and the immense plain at
his feet lay full of earthy vapor and vague
gloom. Night was gathering behind, night was
gathering below, but beyond the vast sweep of
dark the western sky was still aglow with a great
splendor of the purest emerald-green. Rising
steep and solitary, each one, from the dark
of the plain, a thousand black mountains
towered to the green light, their heads crowned
with rosy glows of fire. Some from their burning
craters tossed great showers of golden
sparks; some were crowned with huge tongues
of many-colored flames; some poured forth
rolling smoke; and over others hung clouds
illumined with the red of fire deep below. Presently
the green of the sky deepened and died,
and night came to the Land of Fire.</p>

<p>These Fiery Mountains, I must tell you, were
the forges of the people of the kingdom, who
were sturdy smiths, armorers, and artificers,
one and all. Their royal city stood half upon
the plain, half upon the slope of the greatest
of the burning heights, and everything within
it was of iron made. Of iron were the king’s
palace and his throne, of iron the royal crown,
of iron the money, of iron the houses, of iron
the walls and towers, and of iron the motionless
and shrill-tongued trees along the way.</p>

<p>And now Aileel took service with the Lord of
the Royal Forge that he might learn from him
all the world’s wisdom of iron and of fire. The
great iron halls of the royal forge were built in
the caves of the Fiery Mountains, and within
them toiled Aileel from daylight to the dark,
his ears half deafened with the music of a
thousand anvils, and the rumbling-grumbling
of the great forge-fire. Presently the Lord of
the Forge became so pleased with the skill, the
industry, and the good spirit of the comely
young smith, that he took him to lodge in his
huge iron house.</p>

<p>One morn Aileel said to his friend and master,
“Honored sir, it is in my mind to fashion
something never yet seen in the Kingdom of
Iron. Grant me, I pray, the great chamber
beyond the black cave to be my very own.”</p>

<p>“It shall be yours, worthy Aileel,” replied the
Lord of the Royal Forge. “Here is the key.”</p>

<p>From morn till night, behind the locked door,
the people of the royal forge heard Aileel toiling
at his secret task. Now they heard him at
his anvil, now they heard him carrying his iron
to melt in the fires of the mountain, now they
heard him whistling snatches of a tune.</p>

<p>“What can he be making?” said they, and
they peeked through the keyhole, but could
see nothing at all.</p>

<p>But now you must hear of Potpan and Ailinda.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At first, with Aileel driven from the village and
venturing afar, the poor maiden had gone
about in deadly fear of Potpan and Tharbis;
but as both of them had a wholesome respect
for Braulio, it had fortuned that her lot was
neither worse nor better than before. Tharbis
still scolded her to work, shirking Potpan gave
her oft a heavy task, yet day by day, in spite
of all their ugly tricks, brave and patient
Ailinda grew to be quite the loveliest maid in all
the land. Finally even Potpan himself began
to see her loveliness, and told her one evening
that they were to be married in a fortnight’s
time! Wild with anxiety and determined to
run away rather than enter into any such hateful
alliance, Ailinda sought out Braulio and
told him of her plight.</p>

<p>“Fear not, Ailinda,” said the brave smith.
“Though a fortnight be but a little time, and
the Kingdom of Iron a week’s journey down
the world, yet shall Aileel be here before this
wedding comes to pass. I will fetch him myself
and at once!”</p>

<p>And now Braulio climbed to the saddle of his
huge white horse, and galloped off on the road
to the Fiery Mountains. Alas, just as the smith
was descending the slope to a glass bridge over
a river, the white horse stumbled and fell,
throwing Braulio over his head and laming him
severely. Hobbling along, lame horse, lame
master, the pair made so slow an advance to
the Kingdom of Iron, that it was not until
midnight of the thirteenth day that Braulio
knocked at the iron door of the Lord of the
Royal Forge.</p>

<p>Seated in a great chair of wrought black iron,
Braulio poured forth his unhappy story to
Aileel, the Lord of the Royal Forge, and the
latter’s good wife. Strange to say, an odd little
smile gathered on Aileel’s lips as he heard the
tale, even such a smile as he had worn when he
had tossed Potpan in the pool.</p>

<p>“The wedding morn of Potpan and Ailinda?”
said Aileel. “That shall never be! Come, take
heart, good friends, and quick, all of us to the
chamber in the cave!”</p>

<p>The night was clear and windless, but only the
brightest stars were to be seen, for the great
Fire Mountain above the city was crowned
with an immense whirl of gold and orange
flame which flooded town and sky with flaring
light. Up a broad iron stair, along the slope,
and into the mountain through a mighty iron
portal, fled the little company. Bright torches
gleamed in the iron halls and caves, the roar
of the great forge shook the earth, and the iron
floors were warm beneath their feet. And now
as Aileel unlocked his door and flung it open
wide, his friends uttered together a great cry
of joy and surprise.</p>

<p>The young smith had fashioned a wonderful
flying bird of iron! Its wings, which it flapped
like a real bird, were of iron tempered a lovely
jewel-blue, its breast was of iron forged to a
silver-gray, and its beak and claws and living
round eyes were of iron as red as fire. Within it
a spring of iron lay, which one wound up with
a huge black key; one steered it by pulling
shiny iron chains attached to a collar round its
neck. And there was a great comfortable seat,
too, in the body between the wings&mdash;a seat
with a huge high back in the fashion of a
splendid sleigh, cushions of sunniest larkspur-blue,
and just enough room for three.</p>

<p>So Aileel wound up the spring, clickety clack,
clickety clack, clickety clack, bundled Braulio
into the seat, swung back a lofty door he had
opened in the side of the mountain, waved
farewell, and flew out into the golden glow of
the fiery night. Over the forges of iron he fled,
and saw their flaming deeps and felt their hot
breath; he winged his way over woodlands and
mountains and rivers and gleaming lakes.
Braulio, beside him, hung on to his hat all the
time, and only once in a while looked over the
side. On and on went Aileel and Braulio, yet
the sunrise found them far away from the land
of the Blue Hills.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now it was the wedding morn and the
wedding hour; the sun was shining, bells were
ringing, and music was sounding in the street.
Fearful of her running away, Potpan had locked
Ailinda in her chamber, first advising her to
put on a merry countenance lest she be well
slapped. Presently women of the village came
to attire her in wedding finery, and Ailinda,
her heart sunken in a despairing dream, suffered
them to do their will.</p>

<p>The bells were ringing now their loudest peals,
and presently Potpan pushed Ailinda rudely
up to a place on the seat of the gay cart which
was to carry them to the wedding festival. This
bridal cart was painted a fine bright blue, its
sides and the spokes of its two great wheels
were garlanded with flowers, an arch of flowers
had been built over the seat, and the two snow-white
oxen who drew it brandished horns gilded
with bright gold.</p>

<p>Clang! clang! ding dong dong! went the village
bells. Swaying their huge heads from side
to side, and ringing golden bells upon their
yoke, the white oxen slowly drew Potpan and
Ailinda down the village street.</p>

<p>And now all at once there were cries and shouts
of alarm. “Run! run, everybody! Run! Run!
The bird! Oh, see the bird!” Soon one and
all were scrambling here and there into houses,
down cellars, under tables, into clothes-closets
and up trees till there was not a soul in sight.
Never stopping to take thought of Ailinda,
cowardly Potpan leaped from his seat at her
side, and ran and hid in a plum tree.</p>

<p>All, all alone stood the gay cart in the deserted
street, all, all alone sat the deserted bride. The
oxen came to a halt. A bell somewhere on their
harness jangled, and then the world was very
still.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer and lower and lower through
the sky came the giant bird, flapping its shining
wings. Suddenly its shadow fell across the
cart. Ailinda sank in a swoon against the arch
of flowers. But now the great bird settled to
earth on its claws of red iron, and tall Aileel,
leaping forth, gathered Ailinda in his strong
arms, and waked her from her sleep. Closed now
were the gates of unhappiness; open were the
gates of joy.</p>

<p>“Where is Potpan?” said Aileel sternly.
Ailinda, recovering from her swoon, made faint
motions in the direction of the plum tree.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="aileel" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/aileel.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>And now, all at once, there were cries and shouts of alarm. “Run!
Run, everybody! The bird! Oh, see the bird!”</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>And now Aileel disappeared for a little while,
and all at once there was a yell, a terrible
splash, and a loud chorus of the most indignant
squawking and quacking. Aileel had tossed
Potpan once more into the duck pond!</p>

<p>Then Aileel came back, tall and handsome as
could be, and lifted pretty Ailinda to the seat in
the iron bird. Then he got in himself, set the
wings to flapping, and guided the iron bird
into the air and home to the wonderful Kingdom
of Iron.</p>

<p>And there, in the house of the Lord of the
Royal Forge and amid great rejoicing, Aileel
and Ailinda were wed. Good Braulio, I am
glad to say, remained with them, and all three
lived happily together all their days.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WONDERFUL_TUNE">THE WONDERFUL TUNE</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, a young minstrel wandered
over hill, over dale, through the world, earning
his bread as he strayed by piping on a penny-pipe
to all who cared for a tune. Young was he
and little of stature, his eyes and his hair were
brown, and in bright blue was he clad.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as he wandered
through the world, the little minstrel said to
himself one morn, “If some tunes make people
merry, and others make them sad, whilst still
others make them dance, why should there not
be a tune so wondrously pleasant and gay that
all who chance to hear it must remain joyous of
heart, and can never be sad or bad or unhappy
again? Down the roads of the world I shall
seek the wonderful tune.”</p>

<p>And, with this new thought in his mind, the
little minstrel continued on his way through
the world, bidding good-morrow to all, questioning
all. And some there were who thought
him mad and were scarcely civil; others pushed
him aside as a jesting vagabond; and there
were even those who would have cast him into
prison as a disturber of the public mind and a
wandering rogue. But there were others, too,
and these were the brave and the merciful and
the kind and the merry, who speeded him on
his way and wished him luck in his quest.</p>

<p>The summer ripened and came to an end;
the crackled leaves tumbled and fled before a
howling wind; snow covered the lonely fields;
and still the little minstrel roamed the world,
seeking the wonderful tune.</p>

<p>Now it fortuned that, as the little minstrel
turned his steps to the west, he arrived in the
city of a king whose court musician was said
to know all the tunes in the world. Travel-worn,
brown of face, and humbly clad as he
was, the youth made his way through the
palace and, cap in hand, knocked gently at the
great musician’s door.</p>

<p>From behind the little green door, long runs
and wiggles and cascades of tinkling notes
came dancing out into the quiet of the deserted
marble corridor. The youth knocked yet again.
Presently the notes ceased, and, opening the
door with a stately bow, the court musician
invited the young wanderer within.</p>

<p>And now the youth found himself in a pleasant
room, painted a fair apple-green and set about
with panels edged with gold; the furniture, too,
was painted green and gold, and there were
flowered curtains, a dozing cat, and a china
bowl. As for the court musician, he was clad
in a superb costume of the most fashionable
lavender brocade.</p>

<p>“Honored Master,” said the little minstrel
respectfully, “I am roaming the world for a
tune so pleasant and merry that, once men
have heard it, they can never be sad or bad or
unhappy again. Pray do you know this wonderful
tune?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I know many a wonderful tune,”
replied the court musician. “Listen, now, was
it this?” And, seating himself at a gay green-and-gold
harpsichord, the court musician
played a merry song full of the most elegant
tinkles and trills.</p>

<p>“No, I am sure that is not the wonderful
tune,” said the little minstrel, looking through
an open window at tiny clouds sailing the
sunny sky of a mild midwinter day.</p>

<p>“Then surely this is it,” said the court musician,
playing a second merry tune.</p>

<p>But the little minstrel shook his head once
more.</p>

<p>“Dear me, dear me! Not the wonderful tune?”
exclaimed the court musician, wrinkling his
brow and pursing his lips. “Ah! Wait! I
think I have it!” And this time he lifted the
cover of the green-and-gold harpsichord so that
the minstrel could see the little picture of
frolicking shepherds painted upon it, and played
a long, harmonious, and majestical strain.</p>

<p>But the little minstrel shook his head again.</p>

<p>“My young friend,” said the court musician,
with something of a fatherly air, closing the
harpsichord as he spoke, “I have played for
you the only three tunes I know which might
be the wonderful tune. Are you quite sure you
are not wasting your life upon this quest?
Perhaps such a tune as you tell of was once
known in the world, and is only hidden away;
yet again, perhaps it is all only a dream. You
should go to the Kingdom of Music, and
inquire.”</p>

<p>“The Kingdom of Music,” cried the youth.
“I’ve never heard of such a realm. Pray, sir,
by what road does one go?”</p>

<p>“Come!” said the court musician, taking the
youth by the arm and leading him to the open
window. “See you that land of blue cloud-capped
hills at the world’s edge, and the broad
and winding river which disappears among
them? You have but to follow that stream.
Farewell, young friend, the world is before
you, and may you find the wonderful tune!”</p>

<p>League after league and day after day, the
little minstrel followed the winding river, till
spring stood upon the hills. And now, with the
first sight of the new leaves, the little minstrel
arrived in the land of melody. It was a goodly
land, this Kingdom of Music&mdash;a rolling land
of great fields, sweeping cloud-shadows, and
ancient oaken groves: a land of pleasant murmurs
and sweet sounds. Only birds with pretty
songs dwelt in the Kingdom of Music, and they
sang more sweetly there than in any other
kingdom of the world; the very crickets had a
more tuneful chirp, the river a more various
music, and even the winds blew merry tunes
as they whistled through the trees.</p>

<p>Rejoicing in the kingdom and its sounds, the
little minstrel was strolling along, half in a
dream, when of a sudden sky and land were
filled with a strange, huge, earth-shaking sound,
a sound of the scraping of thousands of fiddles;
of the blowing of thousands of horns, flutes,
trumpets, trombones, and clarinets; of the
clashing and clanging and thumping and bethumping
of thousands of bass drums, kettle-drums,
and cymbals; indeed, in all his wanderings
the little minstrel had never heard such
a din.</p>

<p>The King of the Kingdom of Music was rehearsing
his orchestra.</p>

<p>Every single person in the kingdom, whether
man, woman, or child, was a member of this
orchestra. Babies alone were excepted, though
on one occasion the King had made use of a
gifted child with a musical howl!</p>

<p>Now, when the rehearsal had come to an end
and quiet had returned to the land, the little
minstrel made his way to the royal city, obtained
an audience with the King, and asked
for news of the wonderful tune.</p>

<p>“The wonderful tune,” said the King from
his throne, nodding gravely. “Yes, once there
was even such a wonderful tune! In those days
peace and plenty reigned in the world, and
everyone was happy at his task beneath the
sun. One luckless eve, alas! the tune in some
manner happened to get broken up into notes;
and before anyone could help it, these notes
were scattered and lost through all the kingdoms
of the world. Young man, I fear your
search is in vain; never more shall the sons and
daughters of men hear the wonderful tune.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps someone might gather the
notes together again,” said the little minstrel
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Many have tried to do so,” replied the King.
“Of those who fared away, some returned weary
in the days of their youth, others crept back in
old age, and others yet were lost forevermore.
And never a one returned with a single note of
the wonderful tune.”</p>

<p>“Then is the time come for a new search,”
cried out the little minstrel bravely. “Farewell,
O King of the Kingdom of Music, for I must be
off gathering the notes in the highways of the
world.”</p>

<p>“Farewell, good youth,” answered the King.
“Return to us when your quest is ended; and
may you come piping the wonderful tune.”</p>

<p>And now the little minstrel found himself on
the roads of the world again, strolling from the
first chill gold-and-gray of laggard dawns to the
twilight world of meadows in the gathering
dark and village bells sounding faintly afar.</p>

<p>Seven long years rolled over the world; the
little minstrel searched diligently and far and
wide, yet never a trace could he find of a single
note of the wonderful tune. His blue coat,
which had been so gay, was now sadly tattered
and torn; even his penny-pipe had a dent in it,
and his shoes, alas! were scarce worth the putting-on
in the morn.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, on a day in the early
winter, that the little minstrel arrived in a
northern land and followed a woodland road
through the silence and the cold. The sky was
overcast with a wide tent of dull gray cloud,
through which a sun swam, cold as a moon;
and the whole world was very still&mdash;so still
indeed that the only sound the little minstrel
could hear was the scattering of the leaves
beneath his feet. Twilight came, and found the
little minstrel far from a house or village; a
cold wind arose, and presently a thick snow
began to fall. And now the night and the snow
closed in upon the wanderer. Huddled in his
ragged cloak, the little minstrel trudged bravely
on into the whirling storm; but little by little
the cold crept into his body and bones, a
weariness and a hunger for sleep overcame
him, and suddenly he sank unknowing in the
brambles by the road.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again, a great open
fire was burning before him on a huge hearth;
a blue mug of steaming milk lay waiting at one
side; and over him there bent anxiously two
kindly young folk&mdash;a sturdy country-lad in
a green smock, and a pretty lass in a dress of
homespun brown. These twain were a young
husband and wife who lived in a little house in
the wood, loving each other dearly, working
contentedly at their daily tasks, and dealing
hospitably and generously with all. Returning
through the storm from a distant sheepfold,
the young countryman had found the little
minstrel lying in the snow and had carried him
on his shoulders to the shelter of his home.</p>

<p>After a few days had passed, and the little
minstrel felt quite himself again, he told his
generous friends of his search for the notes of the
wonderful tune. It was at night that he told of
his quest; the supper had been cleared away,
the house was still, and the little minstrel and
his hosts were gathered by the fire.</p>

<p>“A note of the wonderful tune&mdash;bless me,
but I think we have one in this house!” exclaimed
the young wife. And she went to the
mantel and fished about in an ancient brown
bowl standing in the gloom. “Yes, here it is,
sure enough&mdash;a note of the wonderful tune!”</p>

<p>And thus did it come to pass that the little
minstrel obtained the first note of the wonderful
tune; for the young husband and wife were
quick to make a gift of it to their guest.</p>

<p>But now you must hear how he found all the
notes save the last.</p>

<p>The second note the little minstrel discovered
on a glorious midsummer day. It had lain in
an old bird’s-nest in the heart of a great tree,
and a chance breeze tumbled nest and note
together at the minstrel’s feet.</p>

<p>The third note had been hidden away amid
the books of a famous scholar who lived all
alone in an ancient tower, gathering the wisdom
of the world.</p>

<p>The fourth note was given the minstrel by
a little child whose toy it was.</p>

<p>The fifth note was turned up out of the earth,
on a spring morning, by a whistling ploughman
who saw the minstrel passing by and
called to him to come and see the strange thing
he had found.</p>

<p>The sixth note the minstrel had of a weaver,
who labored in his own house at his own loom
and upon it wove fair and beautiful things.</p>

<p>The seventh note a great nobleman possessed;
he dwelt in his castle free of little fears and
mean rivalries; and truth and courage and
honor were his squires.</p>

<p>The eighth note the minstrel had of a young
sailor, who chanced to discover it in an old
ship that sailed the seas.</p>

<p>Of the ninth and last note, however, there
was still no sign; so the little minstrel put the
eight others into his pocket that had no hole
in it, and turned again to his quest. And presently
he walked over a hill into the Kingdom of
the Blue Lakes, where reigned the Lady Amoret.</p>

<p>Now the Kingdom of the Blue Lakes was
quite the fairest of all the kingdoms of the
world, and Amoret the fairest Queen. Her
palace stood on an open hill by her kingdom’s
eastern bound; of golden-white marble was it
made, and from its terrace one looked westward
to distant mountains over a woodland
bright with lakes. All day long there a gay court
of lords and ladies in silks and fine array held
festival; the music of lutes and violins was
ever to be heard; and scarce an hour there was
but had its pleasure, and scarce a pleasure but
had its hour.</p>

<p>Clad in a queen’s robe of scarlet and cloth of
gold, and seated in a jeweled throne raised
upon the terrace, the Lady Amoret received
the ragged pilgrim of the tune.</p>

<p>“The last note of the wonderful tune?” said
the Lady Amoret. “Seek no more; it is here.
Beyond the palace domain, by a lake in the
depths of the wildwood, my court fool has built
for himself a bower, and upon its wall hangs
the last note of the wonderful tune. Tarry
with us a while, and you shall have it. I
promise you.”</p>

<p>“May I not go this very instant and find it,
Your Majesty?” asked the little minstrel
anxiously. “Long have I roamed the world
in search of it, and I need it so for the tune!”</p>

<p>“Nay, tarry a while,” answered the Queen,
unyielding; “for even were I to bid you go, you
would never find the bower, so cunningly is it
hidden in the wood. You have wandered long
and afar, good friend; tarry now a while from
your quest. My kingdom is the fairest in the
world, and you shall have all you desire.”</p>

<p>And Amoret gave a command that new apparel
of the fairest blue cloth be prepared for the
little minstrel and that a place be set for him
at the royal board.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as the Lady Amoret
and her court beheld how brave a youth the
little minstrel appeared in his new apparel,
and hearkened to the thousand wonderful tales
he had to tell of his quest, they found him the
best company in the world and determined to
hold him in the realm. To this end, therefore,
they strove to drown the memory of his quest
in a tide of gayest merriments; but, in spite
of feasts and festivals, the little minstrel never
once forgot the last note of the wonderful tune.</p>

<p>Try as he might, the little minstrel could
never find the note. Again and again he had
tried to make his way to the fool’s bower, only
to lose himself in the tangled paths of the wildwood;
again and again he had questioned the
court fool, only to be met with a mocking
courtesy, a finger to the lips, and a jesting wink
of the eye. One day he even ventured to remind
the Lady Amoret of her promise, but she only
laughed at him for his impatience and swept
him off in her golden boat to a pageant on the
lakes.</p>

<p>Now it happened on the following morning
that the Lady Amoret, taking counsel with her
court, determined to destroy the note, lest the
minstrel should discover it, and go. Summoning
the captain of the palace guard before her,
she said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Go to-night to the bower of the court fool;
take the last note of the wonderful tune, and
fling it into the depths of the lake.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now it was night, and the lords and ladies
of the court, strolling forth from dinner, walked
through the palace to the terrace of the west.
A storm was gathering afar, an approaching
thunder growled, and lightning, flashing in the
sky, was mirrored in the waters of the lakes.
Presently there came wind and a patter of
rain, and soldiers of the palace guard entered
to close the windows and the doors.</p>

<p>The little minstrel stood apart by a great
window, gazing forth into the darkness and
the storm. His fine new clothes weighed like
lead upon his shoulders; his jeweled neckcloth
scarce left him free to breathe; and with all
his heart he longed for his rags, his liberty, and
the cool rain on his eyes.</p>

<p>But the last note&mdash;he could not leave that
behind. Suddenly he heard one soldier say to
another:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Our companions will be caught in the storm;
they have ridden forth with the captain to the
fool’s bower, to destroy the last note of the
wonderful tune.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the note, the note, my note! Oh, what
shall I do?” cried the minstrel, his heart sinking
into depths of despair. “Even now it may
be lost to the world&mdash;this time forever! I
must find the court fool; he shall tell me where
the bower lies!” And he looked about in the
splendid throng for the fantastic motley of the
fool; but he saw only many in rich garments,
and the gleam of jewels reflecting many lights.</p>

<p>Suddenly he chanced to recall that the court
fool dwelt in the garret of the palace, so up
great and little stairs he fled to the fool’s
chamber in the eaves. The rain was now falling
in torrents on the roof close overhead, and
all at once a terrible peal of thunder shook the
palace to its depths. Never pausing to knock,
the little minstrel burst in at the door.</p>

<p>Candles were burning within the humble chamber,
lightning flared at an oval window, and the
court fool stood in the centre of the floor, still
in his motley clad.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said the court fool, with a low
bow and a mocking smile, “allow me to present
you with the last note of the wonderful tune.”
And with those words he handed the note to the
very much astonished youth.</p>

<p>“I feared lest mishap destroy it,” continued
the court fool, “so yestereve I took it from my
bower. You see, I believe in the wonderful tune;
and without my note, this last note, your tune
would scarce be worth the playing. And now,
your hand, little minstrel, for you must hurry
away at once through the wind and rain.”</p>

<p>So the minstrel pressed the hand of the court
fool and, hastening down a tiny corner staircase,
went forth into the storm. And as he
fled, he cried aloud to the thunder and the rain
and the wild wind:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The wonderful tune, the wonderful tune!
I have it, I have it&mdash;the wonderful tune!”</p>

<p>And now the storm wore itself away, the
summer stars shone forth in the clearest of
blue skies, and the only sound to be heard was
the rain drip-dripping from the trees. Drenched
to the skin, but with a fire of joy in his heart,
the minstrel hurried through the night toward
the Kingdom of Music far away.</p>

<p>When he arrived there, on a summer’s morning,
he found the people of the palace assembled
in the hall of state, and the King upon his
throne.</p>

<p>“I have it, Your Majesty!” cried out the
little minstrel breathlessly; “I have it, every
note; here is the wonderful tune!”</p>

<p>“What! The wonderful tune?” cried the King,
leaping to his feet. “Quick, somebody, ring all
the bells, send trumpeters through the streets,
assemble the orchestra, and call hither the
Violinist-in-Chief, the Lord Organist, and the
Grand Harper. We shall play it over at once!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“H-m,” said the Violinist-in-Chief, after he
had put on his huge spectacles and studied the
wonderful tune, “Don’t you feel that those
last bars ought to be played very fast, like this:
tum-diddy-tum&mdash;tum-diddy-tum&mdash;tum-diddy-tum&mdash;diddy-dum-dum-dum?”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="tune" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/tune.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>“No, I do not agree with you,” shouted the Lord Organist</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>“No, I do <i>not</i> agree with you,” replied the
Lord Organist, a huge personage with a majestic
air and a bad temper. “Those bars should be
played slowly,” here he waved a large, solemn
finger, “like this: tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum&mdash;tum!”</p>

<p>“You are both entirely wrong,” interrupted
the Grand Harper, a short contradictory fellow
with long arms and long fingers. “To my
way of thinking the entire tune should be played
throughout in the same time, in this fashion;
listen to my tapping now: da-da&mdash;dee-dee&mdash;da-da&mdash;dee-dee&mdash;da-da&mdash;dee-do-dum.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! Absurd! No, never!” cried the
Lord Organist and the Violinist-in-Chief in one
long indignant breath. “We appeal to the
King!”</p>

<p>But the King had ideas of his own on the
matter.</p>

<p>And thus it was that the musicians all took
to quarreling as to how the wonderful tune
should be played, and are quarreling still.</p>

<p>But some day they will make up their minds
as to how it should go; the little minstrel
will leave the Kingdom of Music and come
through the world piping the tune; and then,
oh, then, what times there will be!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MAN_OF_THE">THE MAN OF THE
WILDWOOD</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, on a summer’s morning
after a night’s rain, a country squire’s son stood
within an arched doorway of his father’s house,
gazing upon the hedgerows and the fields. The
sun was shining after the storm, a high wind
was shaking the trees, scurrying gusts fled
through the nodding grass, and silvery white
clouds sailed the arching sky. And beholding
the bright morning and the rain-washed land,
a great longing came into the heart of the
squire’s son to follow the clouds over hill,
over dale, and to see the world. Presently, with
his parents’ blessing locked in his heart’s treasury
and a purse of gold in his pocket, he leaped
to the saddle of his dappled steed, waved his
plumed hat, and galloped away.</p>

<p>Long he rode and afar, and presently he found
himself in the heart of the deepest and darkest
wildwood that was ever to be seen. Before him,
behind him, around him all about, were the
trunks of numberless trees&mdash;trees so tall that
they hid the sky, and made of it but patches
of cloudy white or speckles of blue; trees&mdash;broad
trees, slender trees, trees that were like
men-at-arms, trees that were shy and aloof as
maids, trees that were silent, trees that rustled,
everywhere trees. And deep was the wildwood
silence and unbroken save for the soft pad of
the horse’s hoofs and the rare song of a hidden
bird.</p>

<p>At the close of his third day, the squire’s son
found himself at the gates of a noble city built
of cedar-green glass on an open hill in the heart
of the wildwood.</p>

<p>Now as it was late in the day when the youth
arrived at the city, it came to pass that he went
to an inn for supper and the night. The mistress
of the tavern, I must tell you, was a lonely
orphan maiden named Miranda. Surely there
was never a fairer or a kinder little maid!
Beneath her ancient roof the humble wayfarer
met with as friendly a greeting as his richer
fellow, and with her own hands she gave bread
and milk to the unfortunate and poor.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the youth had been given
a chamber overlooking the court of the inn, and
presently he heard from below a confused din
of voices, laughter, and jeers. In wonder as to
what the cause of the hubbub might be, the
squire’s son drew open his latticed window and
looked down. A great green cage on wheels
was to be seen there, surrounded by a throng
of curious onlookers who poked fingers at something
within it, shrieked catcalls, whistled, and
laughed to split their sides.</p>

<p>The youth descended to the court, and made
his way into the throng.</p>

<p>Within the cage, clad in a gray wolf’s skin,
sat a creature like unto a man. Strong of body
was he, and beautiful to behold. His eyes were
blue and they were the eyes of a wild thing,
and the long hair which fell about his neck was
of the strangest tawny gold. Aware of the
stir made by a newcomer, the prisoner turned,
and fixed the youth with a glance in which lay
pride mingled with despair.</p>

<p>Presently the proprietor of the cage, who
had been baiting his horse at the stables of
the inn, returned and lowered curtains about
the cage and the prisoner. Fearful lest they
be summoned to pay the showman his penny,
the onlookers took to their heels, and soon
the youth found himself alone in the courtyard.</p>

<p>Now this prisoner, I must tell you, was known
as the Man of the Wildwood, for some hunters
had found him in a net which they had spread
in the wildwood a year before. To some an
animal-like man, to others a man-like animal,
the Man of the Wildwood remained a mystery
in the land. As for the prisoner, never a word
said he, and none knew whether he would not
or could not talk.</p>

<p>Securely locked in his cage, the Man of the
Wildwood was shown to all at a penny a head.</p>

<p>And now, as the youth mused alone in the
silence, the maid Miranda came forth to light
the great lantern in the court. A white apron
she wore, a great white cap, and there were
red ribbons on her gown. The squire’s son
thought he never beheld a maid so fair.</p>

<p>Catching sight of the squire’s son, standing
idly by, Miranda said to him, “Pray, good sir,
what may there be in yon cage?”</p>

<p>“The Man of the Wildwood,” replied the
youth. And he told Miranda what he had overheard
amid the throng.</p>

<p>“Alas, poor creature,” said the gentle maiden,
“how bitter must be such a cage to one who
has known the freedom of the wildwood! I
surely must bring him some honey and bread!”</p>

<p>And away she sped to the larder of the inn to
fetch the good cheer. The twilight deepened.
When Miranda returned again, the youth and
the maid walked to the green cage and offered
the gift to the Man of the Wildwood.</p>

<p>For a little space the prisoner, crouched in a
dark corner of the cage, made neither sign nor
sound. Then slowly, very slowly, he approached
the gift of the kind maiden and ate of it hungrily.
And because he had met with so little
pity and compassion, the Man of the Wildwood
was moved to his heart’s deep, and gazed upon
the young folk with strange eyes.</p>

<p>All evening long the squire’s son mused on the
Man of the Wildwood. Suddenly a great pity
possessed him, and going to the showman, he
purchased the prisoner for fifty golden crowns.</p>

<p>And now it was midnight; and the green
cage, drawn by the showman’s horse, rolled
down a deserted road to the edge of the wildwood.
A moon almost at the full sailed the
high heavens, now vanishing under thin, black
clouds, now floating forth through silvery rifts
and isles. Side by side, saying little to each
other, sat the showman and the youth.</p>

<p>Suddenly a high wall of rustling darkness
loomed before them at the verge of a moonlit
field; the cage had reached the gate of the
forest. With a key given him by the showman&mdash;who
was a little afraid&mdash;the squire’s
son unlocked the cage, and freed the Man of
the Wildwood. And even as he did so, a summer
breeze went singing through the wildwood
with a great cry of joy.</p>

<p>Free at last, the Man of the Wildwood said
naught, but lifted his head to the stars. Then
raising his right arm high above his head, he
made a stately sign of salutation to the youth,
and walked like a king into the darkness of the
trees.</p>

<p>The next morning the youth rose early and
set forth once more upon his travels. Cities
he saw, and nations, and kingdoms, but no
one in them whom he thought fairer than
Miranda. As for Miranda, scarce had the
squire’s son ridden away, than she began to
hope for his return.</p>

<p>Little by little the tide of summer rose to its
full, and ebbing, left the gifts of golden autumn
in the fields.</p>

<p>But now you must hear of the three merchants,
the moonstone, and the misfortunes of
Miranda.</p>

<p>It was a harvest eve, and presently Miranda,
watching by the tavern door, beheld three men
habited as merchants making their way along
the city street to the inn. Somewhat to her
surprise, they came afoot. Two of these merchants,
I must tell you, were tall and lean,
whilst the third was short and fat and had
green eyes. Unwilling to refuse, yet somewhat
against her better judgment, Miranda granted
the request of these merchants for lodgment at
the inn.</p>

<p>Now these three merchants, alas, were not
merchants at all but three famous thieves, who
had come to the city to steal a certain celebrated
gem belonging to the king. This gem
was a moonstone&mdash;a moonstone of such rare
loveliness that men fabled that it had tumbled
to earth from the moon, and been found in a
forest glade at the end of a ray of summer
moonshine. In all the world nothing there was
more fair.</p>

<p>And now it was another midnight, and the
three thieves, quitting their rooms in the inn,
stole as quietly as three cats down the oaken
stairway to the empty street. Unknown to
them, however, Miranda&mdash;wakened by their
whispers&mdash;followed close behind, now retreating
into shadowy doorways, now leaning
against a wall lest she be seen.</p>

<p>Presently the rogues approached the huge
darkened mass of the palace, and made their
way into the grounds through the dreaming
gardens. A little fountain splashed somewhere
in the night. The moon had set, and a thin
layer of cloud dimmed the wheeling stars.</p>

<p>Chuckling softly at their success in having
thus far eluded the palace watch, the thieves
now pressed open a little window and crawled
into the tower of jewels. Hurrying as fast as
ever she could, Miranda ran to wake the yeomen
of the guard.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a great outcry, a light
appeared in a window, there were shouts and
a clash of arms, and the thieves came tumbling
out of the window with the moonstone and
vanished, all three, into the starry dark. A
moment later flaming torches moved amid the
trees, a throng of men-at-arms poured into the
gardens, and Miranda found herself a prisoner.</p>

<p>Accused of having harbored the thieves and
of having had a hand in the robbery, the
maiden of the inn was the next morning brought
to trial. Shaken to the heart, yet protesting her
innocence to the last, the poor maiden made
but a confused defense, and presently was
condemned to suffer the sternest judgment of
the law.</p>

<p>When this was pronounced, however, the
friends and neighbors who loved Miranda made
such a tumult in the court that the judgment
was altered, and Miranda was sentenced to
be carried in the gaoler’s cart into the very
depths of the great wildwood, and there
abandoned to live or perish as she might.</p>

<p>And now it was twilight, a golden harvest
twilight; and Miranda, standing with her hands
tied behind her by the wrists and her head bowed
low, was drawn in a two-wheeled cart through
the darkening streets of the glass city, and carried
far out into the pathless regions of the
wildwood. Once there, the gaoler&mdash;who pitied
her&mdash;loosed her from her bonds, gave her a
crust of prison bread, and drove away. Fainter
and fainter grew the noise of the homeward-faring
cart.</p>

<p>The night was moonless, the stars were bright,
and a wild wind from some far waste of the
world was roaring through the trees, now dying
away to a faint and vagrant murmur, now
rising to a great wailing rustling cry that arose
and broke and ebbed like a wave of the sea.
And the swaying branches tossed their clots
of darkness against the stars, whilst underfoot
so dark it lay that naught was to be seen.</p>

<p>For some moments the unhappy maiden,
trembling with dread, stood motionless in the
dark of the wildwood. Strange sounds drifted
to her ears&mdash;the moan of rival branches, the
laughter of running water, and the far cry of
some hunter of the night. Suddenly she felt
herself grow icy cold, and her eyes closing, she
sank to the earth and knew no more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, that very eve, in the distant city,
the squire’s son was riding joyously to the inn.
Presently he reached his long-awaited goal, and
to his great surprise found the windows darkened
and the doorway sealed and barred. Seeing
him thus wandering about, a neighboring
goodwife came forth from her dwelling, and
told him, with tears in her eyes, the cruel fate
of the good Miranda.</p>

<p>“Oh, wicked judgment!” cried the youth.
“Quick&mdash;tell me whither in the wildwood
have they taken her; for I must find her, come
what may!”</p>

<p>“Alas, who can say?” replied the goodwife.
“All that I can tell thee is that the cart vanished
through the eastern gate, adown the
eastern way.”</p>

<p>And now the youth cried to his dappled steed
to press on as he had never done before, and
galloped through the night to the wildwood.
Darker it grew and darker still.</p>

<p>Arriving at length in a little clearing, the
squire’s son bade his horse stand halted, and
plunged into the wildwood, loudly calling and
hallooing for the lost maiden. On and on
through briery thicket and stony mire he blundered
forward in the gloom. Suddenly an unseen
ravine opened beneath him; his feet trod
forward into nothingness; his hands caught
at the air; and with a cry, he fell. And now as
he lay there stunned, strong arms caught him
gently up and carried him away.</p>

<p>When he woke to life again, he found himself
lying on a bed of skins piled near a fire on a
cavern floor. By his side, the torment of his
human prison fallen from him like an evil garment,
noble and beautiful and strong, stood
the Man of the Wildwood.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="wildwood" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/wildwood.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>Before him stood the Man of the Wildwood</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>Lifting himself up and turning toward his
rescuer, the youth poured forth his story and
sought the eyes of the Man of the Wildwood
for a token that he had understood. For a
moment, however, the Man of the Wildwood
made no sign. Then, of a sudden, with a gesture
at once gentle and commanding, he touched
the youth by the hand, and going to the
cave mouth, opened his arms to the dark wildwood,
and called upon it in its secret speech.</p>

<p>And he bade the things of the wild&mdash;the
brethren who go afoot, the kindred of the air,
and the humble folk who crawl upon the earth&mdash;to
go forth through the wildwood and find
the maiden and guard her well. And he called
upon them, too, to follow the thieves, and
make them prisoners of the wood.</p>

<p>And now a great murmur, even such a sound
as heralds the coming of a mighty rain, swept
through the wood. Forth from their dens
creeping came the bears, the gray wolves, and
the little foxes; the shy deer started in their
glens; the birds awakened with a flutter in
their nests and took wing into the starry dark;
the little wood-mice came tumbling out of
their warm beds; and even the spotted snakes
went forth to seek. Almost in less time than it
takes to tell of it, the earth and the air seemed
full of the people of the wild, questing here and
there in search of the maid.</p>

<p>There passed a little time, and suddenly a
great brown owl, half blinded by the firelight,
swooped down to the arch of the cave-mouth
with the news that he had found the maiden
asleep beneath a sheltering pine; and a moment
later a nimble gray hare with upstanding ears
came hopping in with the tidings that the
thieves had been taken on a wildwood road.</p>

<p>Now this news was quite enough to cure the
squire’s son of his fall, so jumping to his feet,
he followed the staring owl and the Man of
the Wildwood to the refuge of Miranda.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Miranda rejoiced to see
the squire’s son! As for the thieves, they came
upon them standing terror-stricken, huddled
together in the heart of a wide circle of watching,
silent, flame-eyed animals. Creepers and vines
had seized upon them as they fled, and bound
their arms behind with leafy fetters.</p>

<p>Suddenly a friendly whinny was heard, and
the dappled steed, guided by a benevolent
badger, came trotting through the wildwood
to its master. To lift Miranda to the saddle
was but a moment’s task. The three thieves
walking ahead, Miranda riding, and the youth
and the Man of the Wildwood following behind,
even thus went the little company through the
forest dark to the edge of the wildwood.</p>

<p>Morning was at hand; only the brighter stars
were left in the wide and cloudless sky; presently
the dawn broke over the green horizon
of the trees.</p>

<p>Arriving at the bound of the forest, the Man
of the Wildwood lifted his arm once more in
token of farewell, and with his animals clustered
about him, watched his friends till they
vanished down the road.</p>

<p>Presently the domes and towers of the city of
glass rose before the little company. A swirling
autumn mist lay over the fields between the
wildwood and the city walls, the sky was rosy
overhead, and hundreds of little bells were
ringing.</p>

<p>Pausing at the eastern gate, the squire’s
son delivered the thieves to the yeomen of the
guard.</p>

<p>On the following morning the three rogues,
brought to trial, declared the innocence of
Miranda, confessed their wickedness, and restored
the moonstone. A stern sentence was
justly theirs; but so pleased was the king at the
return of his jewel that he merely condemned
them to road-mending for a number of years.
To Miranda the king gave a rich reward, to
the squire’s son, a fair house whose windows
looked forth on the treetops of the wildwood.</p>

<p>And thus it came to pass that the squire’s son
married the good Miranda, and lived happily
with his dear wife and little ones many a long
and pleasant year.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MAIDEN_OF_THE">THE MAIDEN OF THE
MOUNTAIN</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time, in a noble realm to the
west of the Golden Plain, there towered to the
sky a solitary height of such majesty and grave
beauty that the realm became known through
the world as the Kingdom of the Mountain.
Mighty, snow-capped, and serene it rose beyond
the little woods and willow-bordered streams.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that a king ruled in the
land who had been left with two little motherless
children, the Prince Ariel and the Princess
Leoline. The Princess was the elder of the two
and, though only three years old, considered
herself quite a grown-up personage; as for the
little Prince, he was but a child in arms. From
a window of their chamber in a tower-top, the
children were wont to look forth over the land
to the mountain rising afar, now blazing white
and bright in the clear midwinter air, now
half concealed in summer’s hazy veil.</p>

<p>And now, with the suddenness of a tempest
shattering the quiet of the night, a wicked
nobleman, Babylan by name, rose against the
good King and challenged him to do battle for
his throne.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that the wise old nurse to
whom the King had entrusted the Princess
Leoline had for some time feared that all was
not well with her master’s cause, so on the day
of battle she climbed to a high tower-top to
see what she could see. Already from afar,
through the dull still morning, could be heard
the sullen tumult of the fray. Closer and closer
advancing, hour by hour louder and louder
growing, the tide of battle approached the very
gates of the stronghold.</p>

<p>Suddenly, enveloped in a cloud of dust, the
first stragglers from the King’s defeated army
burst from a little wood and came hastening
down the road toward the castle. Knowing
only too well that all was lost and that the
troops of Babylan would be soon battering at
the gate, the good nurse caught up Leoline and
hurried down the curving stair to warn the
guardians of Ariel.</p>

<p>Neither Prince nor guardian, however, could
she find. The castle was already in confusion,
people were running hither and thither, an
alarm bell was wildly clanging, and in the
soldiers’ court a runaway was gasping out his
story to a handful of frightened listeners. Well
aware that her first duty must be the safety of
the little Princess sleeping on her shoulder, the
old nurse abandoned the search for Ariel and
fled from the castle with her charge. And
because she had been born in a village of the
mountain and knew the region to be inaccessible
and wild, the brave nurse turned her steps
toward the height.</p>

<p>All night long, down lonely lane and royal
highway, by woodland path and river road the
brave woman hurried through the dark war-shaken
land. The voice of great waters, roaring
in the night under turreted bridges, beat upon
her ears as she fled; messengers galloped by,
spurring fast; and here and there a signal
beacon flamed afar on some high crest. But
presently the swarming stars grew pale, and
streaks of day appeared in the east.</p>

<p>Pausing at a lonely farm at the end of the lowland
way, the nurse begged a crock of milk and
a morsel of bread for herself and Leoline.</p>

<p>To the east, beyond the hills, rose the great
snowy summit of the mountain, outlined
against a clear green sky of dawn.</p>

<p>And now the pleasant fields gave way to
rocky wind-swept pastures, lying at the foot
of a road winding and climbing along a great
ridge of the mountain to a tiny village at a
valley’s height. To the right of this road,
towering steeps of rock soared to a wild, snow-mantled
crest; to the left, the mountain side
fell away, a terrible precipice, to a torrent all
afoam. Up this road fled the old nurse, half
carrying, half dragging the weary and bewildered
Leoline.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the journey’s end, the
day was at its close, the air was hushed, and the
wide chasm of the valley lay dark with mist and
gloom. The sun had set upon the huddled roofs
of the village; but, towering into the upper air,
the ruling summit still beheld the western light
and reflected a rosy splendor in its snows.</p>

<p>Once safe in the village, the old nurse took
refuge in a cottage belonging to her sister, a
widow woman who kept a flock of sheep. Fearful
lest the cruel Babylan in some manner
become aware of the Princess and her refuge,
the good woman wisely determined to keep
secret the true history of her little guest. In
time even Leoline herself forgot all about the
palace.</p>

<p>Thus did it come to pass that Leoline the
Princess became Leoline the Maiden of the
Mountain.</p>

<p>As for the Prince Ariel, his fate remained a
mystery. Some said the poor little Prince had
perished in a sort of prison, some whispered
that the wicked new King had caused him to
be abandoned in the wildwood. But, whatever
the truth may have been, no one at the palace
saw him or heard from him any more.</p>

<p>And now passed many years. Safe within her
refuge in the mountain, the Princess Leoline
grew from a rosy-cheeked mountain child to a
tall, blue-eyed, golden-haired shepherdess. Far
and wide through the villages of the height
ran tales of her stout-heartedness and great
daring, her gentleness and courtesy as well.
Again and again, in quest of a strayaway or
seeking some rare flower of the snows, she had
made her way to heights to which none had
ever dared aspire. Indeed, so fearless was the
royal shepherdess that presently a poor woman
to whom she had brought an armful of snow
violets cried out to her that she must surely
be under the protection of the Giant of the
Mountain!</p>

<p>“The Giant of the Mountain,” asked Leoline,
“who is he? Pray tell me, for I have never before
heard of him.”</p>

<p>And she turned her head to gaze wonderingly
on the wild crest of the mountain half hidden
in the morning mist.</p>

<p>“The Giant of the Mountain is the ruler of the
height,” replied the village goodwife. “At least
so men say, though never in my lifetime have
men beheld him. Perhaps he has hidden himself
away from mortals. But long ago, Maiden
Leoline, in the days of the grandsires, men who
climbed beyond the torrents sometimes heard
a great voice speaking solemn as thunder in the
hills.”</p>

<p>“Would that I might behold him!” cried
Leoline. And with wonder in her heart she
returned to the daily task of watching her
sheep. Clad in a pretty dress of rustic brown
and wearing a kirtle of apple green, the royal
shepherdess was very fair to see.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass on the afternoon of that
very day that, as Leoline was driving her flock
home to its fold, she heard the sound of weeping,
and presently she overtook a little sister-shepherdess
in tears. Catching the child to her,
Leoline endeavored to comfort her and asked
her why she wept.</p>

<p>“Alas! Maiden Leoline,” replied the ragged
little shepherdess, “I weep because the white
lamb which my father bade me guard has
strayed away and is nowhere to be found.
Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?”</p>

<p>And the little shepherdess wept afresh, while
her halted flock lowered their silly heads and
bleated mournfully.</p>

<p>“A white lamb?” said Leoline. “Come, take
heart; he cannot be far away. We shall find
him, I am sure, for the sun is still high above
the west, and the day is far from spent. Do
you but remain here and guard your flock and
mine, while I go to search the pasture by the
snows.” And with these words the kind maiden
turned her face to the height.</p>

<p>Through upland pasture and rocky dell fared
Leoline, scanning the waving flower-strewn grass
for the lost white lamb, and listening for a
forlorn crying; but of the lamb she had neither
sight nor sound. Little by little the afternoon
drew to a close. Presently a chill of cold and
dark crept into the air as the sun vanished
behind a great mass of sombre cloud.</p>

<p>Finding a mountain torrent near at hand,
Leoline followed the edge of the roaring stream
toward the wild steeps of the mountain.</p>

<p>The sky was now but one vast and seemingly
motionless sea of cloud. Beneath this cloudy
tent, however, floating strangely and swiftly by,
fled steamy wisps and fragments of shapeless
mist, and ever and anon one of these fugitives
enveloped Leoline in its chilly veil. Bravely
making her way along a path every step more
dangerous growing, the maiden at length attained
the last sweep of open land. Strewn
with lovely flowers was the field; and two
strange crags, which Leoline had never seen
before, rose from its further bound.</p>

<p>Now as Leoline gazed upon the two crags, the
level floor of rock lifted high between them,
and the pinnacled wall of cliff rising behind,
she beheld that they formed together a marvelous
great throne, of which the two crags
were the carven arms and the cliff-wall the
sculptured back&mdash;a throne for a giant being
mighty as the mountain: a being whose feet
were of the earth and whose body rose to the
clouds and the marshaled stars. And this
chair stood exalted high, strange and noble
and dark, now outlined against the sullen
clouds, now caught up and hidden in their
depths.</p>

<p>Presently the unseen sun sank below the crest
of the mountain and a wild dark fell. The
clouds rolled about the craggy throne.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="maiden" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/maiden.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>For a long moment Leoline, awed yet unafraid, gazed at the Giant
of the Mountain</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>And now, of a sudden, a great roaring wind
arose which swept the mountain-top with a
sound of noble music; the cloud veil broke
asunder and rolled away; a rich and sudden
light poured down upon the field; and Leoline
beheld the great throne uplifted high against
the sunset’s flare. And within the throne,
mantled in a robe that might of cloud have
been spun, sat a giant being. The western light
was about his head, his hands rested on the
crags, and there was mystery in his eyes.</p>

<p>For a long moment Leoline, awed yet unafraid,
gazed at the Giant of the Mountain. Then
came a sound like unto a far trumpet-clang,
the winds were again unleashed, the clouds
once more gathered together, and throne and
Giant vanished in the mountain gloom.</p>

<p>All at once Leoline heard a pitiful cry and,
looking down, beheld the lost lamb at her
feet. Whence could it have come? It was
nowhere to be seen a moment before.</p>

<p>Lifting the lamb gently up, Leoline carried it
through the twilight to the little shepherdess.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now a year and half a year again passed,
and presently disorder reigned once more within
the realm. Weary of Babylan and his tyrannies,
the people of the land were gathering from
far and wide to drive him from his throne.
Surely there was never a worse King! Did he
demand gold from some unhappy village, gold
would he have, or else the villagers would see
their houses in flames and their lowing cattle
being harried to the royal barns; his prisons
were full of innocent folk whose possessions he
coveted or against whom he had taken a grudge;
no longer in the land was to be found that
friendly spirit and good cheer which had reigned
there in the time of Leoline’s unhappy father.
But, though the anger of Babylan was the anger
of the thunderstroke, there is an end to all
patience; and presently the land rose against
the King.</p>

<p>The leader of the people in this strife was a
young forester of humble birth, named Norbert.
This daring youth, I must tell you, had
once been imprisoned by Babylan for saving
a poor family from his oppression, but had
succeeded in escaping to the mountain. Courteous,
generous, and brave as a lion, the young
Captain was the idol of the land.</p>

<p>Presently the tidings of the revolt arrived at
the village in the mountain, and from rocky
pasture and upland field the youth of the neighborhood
gathered in the village square to choose
their chief. And because Leoline was so spirited
and daring, they cried out that she must be
their leader and that no other would they obey.
Riding at the head of her band of sturdy
mountaineers and clad in the armor of a
young knight, even thus went the shepherdess
Princess to the wars.</p>

<p>Little by little the army of the revolt swept
towards the stronghold of Babylan, and presently
encamped at the foot of a huge ridge of
land no great distance from the city. And there,
in the meadows below the ridge, the people
slept, doubting not that the next eve would see
their victorious standards in the city streets
and Babylan their prisoner.</p>

<p>But when came the dawn they beheld the terrible
black horsemen of Babylan drawn up in
line along the ridge. The sky was pale behind
them, they moved not, and little awakening
breezes fluttered their dark bannerets. Midway
in the sombre rank, mounted upon a giant
charger halted a little ahead of the others, was
to be seen the wicked King. All at once there
were trumpet calls, some near, others afar, and
with a great wild echoing cry the host of Babylan
swept galloping down the slope of the ridge
upon the surprised soldiery of the people.</p>

<p>And now all was confusion indeed! A panic
was at hand. Emboldened, however, by the
coolness, courage, and resource of Norbert, the
army of the revolt, though taken by surprise,
rallied quickly and held its ground. All day
long thunder of arms resounded from the fair
green fields and fruit-laden orchards. Norbert
performed prodigies of valor, and Leoline was
ever to be found in the thick of the fray. Now
at the head of her mountaineers she brought
succor to an encircled group of her comrades in
the revolt, now from Babylan’s own color-bearer
she wrested the black standard with the scarlet
eagles, now was she to be seen giving water to
both wounded friend and foe. But, alas! as the
day grew old and the shadows lengthened, the
host of Babylan slowly gained the mastery,
and by nightfall the army of the people was
fleeing in disorder through the highways and
the fields.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that Leoline, forced at
length to abandon the struggle in which she
had played so brave a part, discovered Norbert
lying wounded and unheeded in an orchard.
Dismounting from her horse, she lifted the
young leader to the saddle and, accompanied
by her faithful troop, hurried through the
night toward the village in the mountains.</p>

<p>And now it was once more dawn. Presently
Leoline, Norbert, and their followers arrived at
the little cottage in which Leoline’s old nurse
and foster mother awaited her return. It was
cold, and a crackling fire was burning on the
huge hearth. After placing their unhappy young
leader on a little pallet, the mountaineers withdrew,
leaving Leoline and her foster mother to
care for him. As for poor Norbert, alas! so weak
was he that he lay helpless and unknowing.</p>

<p>And now, of a sudden, there came a swift
knocking at the door, and opening it, Leoline
discovered there the little shepherdess whose
white lamb she had found the year before.</p>

<p>“Oh, Maiden Leoline,” cried out the little
shepherdess, “I have come to warn you! The
King has discovered this refuge and is on his
way here with a troop of horsemen. They are
mounting the road along the ridge; my father
has seen them from the high rock. Oh, make
haste and hide or you will fall into his cruel
hands!”</p>

<p>“But our Captain; what of him?” asked Leoline.
“We cannot desert him in his hour of sorrow
and defeat. Quick, give me your aid, and
we will hide him away in yonder pines.”</p>

<p>But the old nurse shook her head. “Nay,” she
said, “stir him now, and he will never again
waken into life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Maiden Leoline, do make haste,” cried
the little shepherdess, holding the door ajar.</p>

<p>“Nay, little sister,” answered Leoline, shaking
her head, “here shall I remain. Farewell,
little friend; I thank thee for the warning.”</p>

<p>Now rose the morning sun in splendor over
the shoulder of the mighty mountain, rolling
away the mists and revealing the dewy fields,
the crags, and the eternal snows in all their
bright unsullied loveliness. Leaving Norbert
in the care of the old nurse, Leoline ran to the
high rock.</p>

<p>Before and below her lay the village, then the
deep gulf of the valley opening toward the distant
plain. All at once the Princess beheld
Babylan and his men! Up the road leading
along the side of the higher crest they were
mounting. Ever and anon, on lesser slopes of
the winding road, they galloped their steeds.</p>

<p>Now crept despair into the heart of the brave
Leoline even as the bitter cold of a winter’s
night creeps into a room when sinks the fire.
And in her heart she beheld the helpless Norbert
in the hands of his enemy, her people flying,
pursued, to the caverns in the mountain, and
her village laid low.</p>

<p>But of whom could she now seek aid? Along
the snow-crested ridge nearer and nearer rode
the wicked King.</p>

<p>Suddenly Leoline recalled to mind the Giant
of the Mountain. Turning her face toward the
mountain peak, she lifted her arms to it and
cried aloud:&mdash;</p>

<p>“O Giant of the Mountain, O Giant of the
Snows, help us in our need!”</p>

<p>Loud and clear rang the cry of Leoline through
the mountain air and was followed by a silence.</p>

<p>A breeze shook the branches of the dwarfed
pines; a bird sang.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a far high murmur trembled
to a roar, a roar loud and terrible enough to
drown all the sounds of the world, and from
the snow-capped ridge above the road there
flowed and rolled down on Babylan and his
men a mighty avalanche. Huge stones were
there in it, glistening ice and snow, brown
earth and uprooted pines. Sweeping over the
road, the mass poured over the precipice into
the valley-depth a league below.</p>

<p>Such was the end of the wicked Babylan.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, because his horse
had gone lame, one of Babylan’s men had fallen
behind and, as a consequence, had escaped the
avalanche. Upon this fellow the mountaineers
quickly fell and were about to do him a mischief
when the horseman cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hold! Hold! I, and I alone, can tell you
of the lost Prince Ariel.”</p>

<p>Hearing these words, the mountaineers
thought it wise to take their captive to Leoline.
Bound securely, the horseman was thrust into
a corner of the cottage and commanded to tell
his story to the assembled company.</p>

<p>“Babylan gave me the Prince Ariel,” said the
man at arms, “and bade me abandon him in
the wildwood. But I obeyed not his cruel word
and left the child with a good forester, named
Hildebrand of the Oaks.”</p>

<p>Now, when the horseman had spoken, all present
knew that, by a strange and wonderful
turn of Fortune’s wheel, their young leader
was likewise their lawful lord and king. For
Norbert the daring had passed as the son of
the forester, Hildebrand of the Oaks.</p>

<p>And now it was the old nurse’s turn to speak.
Said she, “Long enough have I kept my counsel,
but now that the danger which kept me
silent is no more, I may tell all. Our Leoline,
whom you have known as Leoline, the shepherdess,
is Leoline, our Princess and own sister
to Prince Ariel.”</p>

<p>And she told them all of her flight to the
mountain and of how she had saved the little
Princess from the cruel Babylan. You will
believe that Leoline was amazed to find herself
a real Princess. But her heart was filled with
joy and pride because of her brother’s deeds.</p>

<p>Now, when Ariel’s wounds had healed and his
strength had returned, the people of the mountain
escorted him in triumph to the royal city,
and there, amid universal joy, the brave Prince
claimed and received his own. The annals of
Fairyland tell of no better King. I am glad to
say that he richly rewarded both the man at
arms and the old nurse.</p>

<p>As for Leoline, she took the Mountain for her
kingdom and, under the protection of the Giant
of the Height, dwelt there long in peace and
happiness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BELL_OF_THE_EARTH">THE BELL OF THE EARTH
AND THE BELL OF
THE SEA</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time a brave mariner, who had
sailed the blue for many years, married a captain’s
daughter and went to live in a pleasant
inland country a long way from the sea. Now
it came to pass that, as the sailor and his wife
dwelt in the inland vale, a sturdy son was born
to them whom they named Altair; and this
little son grew to manhood with a great longing
in his heart to go companying with sailors
and sail upon the sea. Presently the old mariner
called his son unto him and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dear son of mine, a sailor were you born
and a sailor you shall be. Go you forth to the
ships, have your fill of a sailor’s life, and may
honor and fortune come to you upon the sea.”</p>

<p>So now the youth Altair bade his dear parents
farewell and followed the northern highway to
a certain great city by the sea. Day after day,
as he walked, the soft blue skies and golden
clouds of the inland country vanished behind,
a brightness and a faint glow of green appeared
in the arching heavens, and a cold northern
wind shook each sombre northern pine. Suddenly
one morn the youth heard from afar the
endless thundering of breakers and, arriving on
a sandy height, beheld great seas tumbling in
foam and white confusion on the shore. And
thus discovering the sea, something in the
heart of Altair shouted and leaped for joy.</p>

<p>To one side and below stood the towers and
masts of the city; there were sailors in her streets
with brown faces, rich merchants in velvet
caps and gowns, brave pilots, and adventurers,
and captains coming and going to their ships.</p>

<p>After purchasing a stout jacket, a knitted cap,
a blue sailor blouse, and a pair of trousers
belling out below, Altair set down his name in
the book of a great ship and sailed away upon
the sea. Seven years he sailed, now through
nights of whispering seas and skies of silent
stars, now through storms and howling winds
and waves blown white with foam. Little by
little the youth’s blue eyes took on the look of
one who sees afar, his body grew strong, and he
walked as a sailor walks, with feet apart and a
roll from side to side. Seven years he sailed,
and then became a captain and master of a
vessel of his own.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as the blue-eyed
captain returned from a long and lonely passage
to the Isles of Gold, he beheld a great
multitude of ships sailing together down the
sea. Across his bow they sailed, great ships
stately as castles of oak, little ships that bobbed
and courtesied to every wave, ships with pennons,
ships with banners, ships of all rigs and
colors in the world. And so great was the multitude
of ships that some had already crossed
the rim of the sea ahead, whilst the swaying
spars of others rose faint and far behind.</p>

<p>In great wonderment as to what the gathering
might portend, the young captain hailed a
passing ship and questioned a master mariner.</p>

<p>“These be the ships of all the world, Sir
Captain,” answered the master mariner, “and
we sail to the land of the King of the South,
for he hath summoned us one and all. There
is great news, they say, awaiting us at journey’s
end, but of what it may be none can tell. But
come: up with your helm, Sir Captain, and
follow through the sea.”</p>

<p>Week after week, through weather fair and
weather foul, Altair sailed with the ships of the
world to the Kingdom of the South. All at
once, one fine night between midnight and the
morn, the men upon the masts of the first three
ships sent back a cry of land, and presently
the great blue light of the Kingdom of the
South shone forth, far away and low upon the
sea. At sunrise the ships of the world, following
one another in line, sailed through rocky
gates into the wide haven of the King.</p>

<p>The palace of the King was built upon a hilltop
between blue mountains and the sea, it was
of golden marble made, and a winding marble
stair led from it to a pavilion and a landing
on the bay. Rising in solitary splendor above
the ancient trees of the King’s garden, a great
belfry-tower soared to the rosy dawn which
overhung the hilltop and the town.</p>

<p>And now, in the hall of columns, stood gathered
the captains of the ships of all the world,
great captains with plumes in their velvet caps
and jeweled swords at their sides, merchant
captains in capes of sober blue, and humble
fisher-captains with knitted caps and blouses
gaily striped. Then came forth to them the
King of the South, clad in a scarlet robe and
a crown of yellow gold, and said to them:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Captains of the ships of all the world, I give
you greeting. You wait to hear why I have
called you from the seas. Hearken then to my
word. A belfry have I built, the fairest belfry
which stands beneath the sun, and I fain would
lodge in it the fairest and noblest bell in all the
world. Find me this bell, O captains of the
ships! Go ye to all nations, and speed through
all the seas.</p>

<p>“He who finds the bell shall be given a
mighty treasure, and be crowned with glory
and honor.”</p>

<p>Thus having said, the King of the South led
the captains of the ships to a great feast which
he had prepared for them, and there they made
merry till the closing of the day.</p>

<p>Now, when the sun had set and the city, the
still harbor, and the ships were bathed in a
gentle golden light, Altair descended the winding
marble stair to the pavilion at which his
ship’s boat lay awaiting his return. Now it
came to pass that, as the young captain approached
the end of the steps, he saw standing
by a marble pillar there an old bent fisher-wife
with a young fisher-maiden at her side. And,
because it seemed to Altair that they were fain
to speak to him, yet a little afraid, the young
captain paused at the pillar and asked the
fisherfolk if some misfortune had come upon
them.</p>

<p>“Good Sir Captain,” replied the maid, “we
are fisherfolk of the Perilous Isles who would
fain return to our homes again. In the springtide
of the year, while my mother and I were
out amid the nets in our little boat, a storm
arose which swept us out to sea. For two bitter
days and nights we fled before the gale, but on
the third morn a great ship chanced to espy us
and, rescuing us from the waves, brought us
to this realm. Long have we sought a way to
return into our own land. You find us here
because of our hope that one of the ships of the
world might be sailing by the Isles. But though
we have asked those who passed before, there
was never a one who could help us on our way.”</p>

<p>And the old fisher-wife shook her head slowly
and sadly, whilst the maid stood still and said
no more. The golden light was fading now from
the city, the still harbor, and the ships. Even
the belfry tower stood dark, its empty bell-chamber
outlined against the sky. Presently
the great blue light at the harbor mouth awoke
in its stately tower, and a sudden wind brought
a little sound of waves on the distant outer
shore.</p>

<p>“Be of good cheer, I will take you to the Isles,”
said the young captain. And, with stately
courtesy, he put the fisherfolk in the boat and
went with them to his ship. Then was heard
the sound of ropes and blocks and the filling of
sails, and presently the ship of Altair fled
away like a bird into the dark sea. Already
there were lights here and there on the dark
waves, the lights of ships gone seeking the
marvelous bell.</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight of favoring wind and
fine weather, the ship of Altair arrived by the
Perilous Isles. Huge and high and dark were
the Isles, and weed-hung reefs encircled them
and tossed fountains of spray into the air.</p>

<p>Off the isle of the fishers, the kings of the world
had prepared a fairway&mdash;for so mariners call
a passage&mdash;through the cruel rocks, and at
the entrance to this passage a warning bell
sank and rose and nodded and swung in the
seas.</p>

<p>And now the fisher-maiden and her mother
bade a grateful farewell to the young captain
Altair and were rowed ashore to the isle. The
name of the maiden, you must know, was
Thyrza. Her eyes were gray, and her hair a
pretty ruddy-gold. And so fair she was and so
honest and true her gaze, that Altair thought
he had never seen her like in all the world.</p>

<p>As for Thyrza, she stood long upon the shore,
watching the ship of Altair until it dwindled
and disappeared at the edge of sea and sky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>North and south, through the seas of the
world, went Altair in search of the bell. To
great cities of golden domes he sailed and
found silver bells, and brazen bells, and even
bells of glass, but never a bell for the belfry
tower; by lonely shores he passed and saw the
far surf break in a border of white between the
yellow sands and the ocean’s sweeping green.</p>

<p>Now it fortuned that the boatswain of the
vessel was an old mariner who had sailed with
Altair since the days of the young captain’s
apprenticeship at sea. And presently this boatswain
came to Altair and said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good master, in the isles of the east was I
born, and in those isles there runs a tale that
somewhere, in the great sea flowing westward
down the world, lies an isle of bells. There is a
city there, they say, whose citizens take such
joy in the ringing of bells that they will be at
it all day long; in the mountains of the isle
are rare metals most fit for noble bells, and
there is a King there who is the bellman of
the world. It may be but an idle tale, but I
tell it as ’twas told to me.”</p>

<p>“East and north and unto the south have I
sought the bell in vain,” said Altair. “Into
the seas of the west none have ever sailed.
Come, helmsman; about, about, and follow
the setting sun; we shall seek this hidden
isle.”</p>

<p>Westward into the bright waves and the great
glory of the sun sailed Altair. Higher grew the
waves, the sun-bright spray fell in showers
about the bow, and streams of marbly foam
ran hissing at each side. A thousand leagues
upon a thousand leagues sailed the ship, and
presently there came a windless night of swaying
ropes, still waters, and the stars. And,
while the ship glided ever so gently on into the
night, there was heard over the sea, faint and
far, a golden sound of bells.</p>

<p>Now uttered the sailors a cry of joy which rang
to the stars and drowned the voices of the bells.
And a wind arose, and the sails filled, and when
it was dawn the mountain isle of bells stood
before them, lonely as a ship in the wide circle
of the sea.</p>

<p>Then to the city of bells they went, and found
bells on every house and tower, and people
wearing bells on the borders of their gowns.
All day long great bells were ringing in their
towers, chimes were pealing, and clusters of
little bells replying&mdash;tiny bells that sang like
children at their play.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, when the old, bearded
King of the Bells heard the tale of the brave
voyage of Altair, his heart warmed to the sturdy
blue-eyed youth and he said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Good Sir Captain, you shall have the bell
you seek, the fairest and noblest bell in all the
world. To-day shall the metal be prepared and
melted in the furnace of the mountains, and
to-morrow at high noon shall the metal be
poured into the mould of the bell.”</p>

<p>And now it was the high noon of the following
day, and the King and his people, together
with Altair and his sailors, stood beside the
fiery pit in which the metal of the bell boiled
in foam of green and red and eddying copper-gold.
Taking a golden cup filled with earth,
the King cast it into the pit, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“O bell, by this token I charge thee to remember
the earth!</p>

<p>“The earth and her sweet sounds, the songs
of birds, the rustle of leaves, the murmur of
brooks, the cry of the night wind, the majesty
of thunder: of these speak to the sons of men!”</p>

<p>And thus having spoken, the old King took a
golden cup of water of the sea, and cast it also
into the molten pit, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>“O bell, by this token I charge thee to remember
the sea!</p>

<p>“The sea and her voices, the roaring of the
mighty waves, the thin whisperings of foam,
the talk of ripples on the shore of sheltered
isles, the tumult of the gale: of these speak to
the sons of men!”</p>

<p>And they poured the fiery metal into the earthy
mould and left it to grow cool. Seven days and
seven nights sped by, and presently came skilful
men to cut the bell from the mould, and sculptors
to carve upon it flowers and trees and
leaves and birds and waves and cockle shells.</p>

<p>And Altair thanked the old King with all his
heart and, stowing the bell in the hold of his
ship, sailed away eastward and southward
through the sea.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as the returning
voyage drew to an end, the young captain
found his ship to be almost empty of victuals
and drink; so he hastened to the nearest port
to see what he could buy. Now it chanced that
there lay in the same port another ship which
was also returning with a bell, a fine bell to be
sure, but not one worthy to be named with the
bell of brave Altair. The name of the captain
of this other ship, you must know, was Kraken,
and he was filled with curiosity to see if the bell
of Altair was a better than his own.</p>

<p>The ship of Altair lay at a wharf, and strong
brown-faced men worked in the hazy sun, rolling
kegs of water to the deck and carrying bags
of meal down into the hold. Presently Kraken,
sitting in the stern of a red boat rowed by six
of his sailors, came over to call upon Altair.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="bell2" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/bell2.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>And stowing the Bell of the Earth in the hold of his ship, the
young Captain sailed eastward and southward through the sea</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>And now Altair and Kraken stood in the dark
hold of the ship, and Altair held up a great
light so that Kraken might see the wonderful
bell. And beholding the bell, how fair it was,
Kraken said in his secret heart:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If the Captain Altair shall return to the
land of the South with this wonderful bell,
my bell will never win the treasure of the King.
I must find a way to destroy this captain and
his bell!”</p>

<p>Turning to Altair he said, “Brother Captain,
when do you sail away?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow at high noon,” replied Altair.</p>

<p>“At high noon?” said Kraken, his envious
eyes suddenly lit with a wicked thought. “You
dare then to sail at night through the reefs of
the Perilous Isles?”</p>

<p>“My ship is fast,” replied Altair, “and I shall
find the floating bell of the fairway before the
sun has set. Once I find it, what is there to
fear? The passage which it marks is deep and
wide. And the Bell has a brave clang.”</p>

<p>And now it was the next morn, and Kraken
sailed early from the port. All morning he
sailed over a lonely gulf of the sea, and arrived
at noon before the Perilous Isles. It was a
windy day, the hazy sky was now open, now
overcast, and here, there, and all about the
reefs were breaking white. Gulls barked and
piped, and the shaggy weed-hung sides of the
nearer reefs rose and fell with the waves.</p>

<p>Presently Kraken caught sight of the floating
bell which marked the entrance to the fairway
of the Isles.</p>

<p>The sea-bell had been made in the fiery mountain
forges of the Kingdom of Iron. Its round
base was of iron, and a band of iron, chiseled
about with fish and shells and flowers of the
sea, encircled its tossing rim. The warning bell
rose from the center of the shield, and two iron
figures, one of a giant, one of a dwarf, struck it
with iron hammers night and day.</p>

<p>And Kraken laughed and sent men to break
the hammers from the hands of the iron figures
so that the bell should sound no more. And
this they did. But the dwarf and the giant
continued to lift and lower their empty hands.</p>

<p>Sailing through the fairway, Kraken continued
on his course to the Kingdom of the
South, and was soon lost to view.</p>

<p>The wicked deed, however, had not passed unseen.
Thyrza, the fisher-maiden, had beheld all.</p>

<p>The long hours of the afternoon dragged to
their close. Sunset was at hand. Black clouds
rose over the edge of the world, the sea darkened,
and the heavy waves grew black and
streaked with foam. A wind began to howl.</p>

<p>Suddenly Thyrza beheld the sails of a great
ship fleeing before the gale. The hidden sun
had almost set, and the black clouds were
barred with rays as red as fire.</p>

<p>“’Tis the ship of Altair,” cried Thyrza. “The
night is gathering fast, and, unless he hears the
bell in the dark, Altair will be wrecked upon the
reefs. I must row to the bell, if I can, and sound
the warning clang.”</p>

<p>And now the courageous maiden hastened to
her little fishing boat and rowed through the
dark and the gathering storm to the soundless
bell. Long and hard she fought, and presently
a great gust of the gale swept her down against
the bell. Great waves were breaking over it in
bitter spray, and it rolled and tossed and turned
and plunged in the sea.</p>

<p>After tying her little boat to one of the figures,
Thyrza took a round stone, which she used as a
weight for a net, and began to sound the bell.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer drew the ship of Altair.
The fiery bars of the sunset faded from the
clouds; the wild night closed in upon the sea.</p>

<p>“Ding&mdash;Dong! Ding&mdash;Dong!” went the
bell. And the wind howled in the dark, and
the waves thundered and broke as they fled.
Suddenly Thyrza saw the lights of Altair’s
ship close at hand; the vessel was safely entering
the passageway.</p>

<p>So near she passed to the bell that Thyrza
could almost have touched her oaken side.</p>

<p>Now, when the lights of Altair’s vessel had
vanished in the night, Thyrza went to unloose
her little boat and row ashore. Some fishers
had seen her on the bell and built a great bonfire
on the beach to guide her safely in. But
suddenly the maid beheld the lights of a second
ship, searching for the fairway and the bell.</p>

<p>Weak and chilled though she was, Thyrza
sounded the bell till this vessel, too, had passed
safely through the reefs. Much to the maiden’s
surprise, this second vessel came about and anchored
in the little fishing-harbor of the Isles!</p>

<p>Guided by the light of the fire, brave Thyrza
safely made her way to the shore.</p>

<p>As for Altair, he continued on to the Land of
the South, and was given the treasure and the
crown of glory and honor for bringing the fairest
and noblest bell.</p>

<p>And the bell of the earth hung in the belfry-tower,
and in the morning and the evening
spoke to men of the wonder and mystery of
the earth and the changing sea.</p>

<p>And now the brave young sailor had riches
and honors like unto a king, yet was he restless
at heart, for he remembered the maiden Thyrza
and was fain to make her his wife. Returning
again to the sea, he sought the Perilous Isles,
and hurried ashore to find the gray-eyed maid.</p>

<p>“You seek the maiden, Thyrza?” asked the
fishers. “Alas! she is gone we know not where.
In the month of the low moon, two great ships
passed at nightfall through the fairway of the
reefs; one ship continued over the sea, and the
other came to anchor in our bay. We fear that
this ship was perchance a pirate ship, for she
sailed away at the break of dawn, and since
that hour Thyrza hath not been seen.”</p>

<p>And the fishers told Altair of how Thyrza had
saved the ships by striking upon the sea-bell;
and Altair remembered the night of which they
spoke, and knew that Thyrza had saved him
from the reefs.</p>

<p>East and west and north and south, along the
shores of the world went Altair in search of the
maid. But never a one he found who could tell
him aught of her. A long year he sailed, and
presently he came to the Kingdom of the Moon.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, when he went to
the palace to ask tidings of Thyrza, attendants
came and led him before the Queen who ruled
the land. And she was very young, and clad
in a silver gown, a silver crown, and a spreading
robe of blue.</p>

<p>Strange to say, a heavy silver veil hid her face
from all.</p>

<p>“Sir Captain,” said the Queen, when she had
heard the story of Altair, “you are wasting
your days in quest of the fisher-maid. She is
gone; you will never see her more. Have done
with this hopeless seeking, and take service in
my realm. Stay, and I shall make you the
kingdom’s admiral.”</p>

<p>But gallant and faithful Altair shook his head
and answered, “No.” And though the Queen
twice and even thrice besought him to stay, he
still remained faithful to his quest.</p>

<p>Then laughed the Queen a little merry laugh,
and tossed the veil aside. And Altair beheld
Thyrza on the throne!</p>

<p>“Dear Altair,” said the Queen, “you shall
hear all. My father was the King of this
country and I was his only child. It fortuned
that one morn we went forth in a ship, and a
great storm arose which drove us from our
course far out into the sea. Presently the ship
struck upon the reefs of the Perilous Isles and
went to pieces fast. Of all aboard, I alone was
saved.</p>

<p>“My subjects long sought for news of the
missing vessel, but in vain. Years passed, and
presently a fisherman of the Kingdom of the
Moon chanced to land at the Isles and heard
from the fishers the story of the wreck. He
returned with the tidings, and my people came
in a great ship to take me to my land. We
hurried away, for a dangerous wind was blowing
and the captain was a stranger to the reefs.
But even now there is a ship on the sea which
carries tidings and gifts to the fishers of the
Isles.”</p>

<p>So now the courtiers and the attendants bowed
politely and withdrew, and Altair and Thyrza
walked together to a great window by the sea.
And there the young sailor and the Queen who
was a daughter of the sea pledged their faith
to one another.</p>

<p>Their wedding was the most splendid wedding
ever seen in all the world. Altair’s good father
and mother were there, Thyrza’s foster mother
too, and all the sailors danced hornpipes and
sang old pleasant songs of the sea.</p>

<p>And they all lived happily ever after.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WOOD_BEYOND_THE">THE WOOD BEYOND THE
WORLD</h2>
</div>

<p>Once upon a time a young knight, named
Alois, went to dwell at the court of a mighty
King until his coming of age, for he was without
kinsmen, and heir to great powers and
possessions. A tiny round room in the castle’s
topmost tower was given him to be his very
own; and from the curving sill of its one great
window he could look down on the gardens of
the palace, the woodland beyond, and see the
older nobles walking two by two behind the
King.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, upon a summer eve, that
the knight Alois beheld from his tower a lovely
golden light moving about on a hillside in the
wood.</p>

<p>“The elves must be dancing on the hill,” said
the young knight. “I’ll ride into the wood, and
watch them from afar.” And gallop-a-gallop
away he rode in the dark. The night was still,
the birds had gone to bed, and a young sickle-moon
was sinking in the west with the old
moon in her arms.</p>

<p>Suddenly the youth beheld the golden light
approaching through the trees.</p>

<p>A pretty maiden in a dress of homespun green,
a white apron, and a little cap was carrying
a golden lantern through the wood. Her eyes
were upon the ground, and every once and a
while she stooped to gather a flower from the
earth and thrust it into a basket by her side.
Dismounting from his horse, Alois followed the
maid afoot, fearful lest the snapping of a twig
reveal his presence in the dark.</p>

<p>And now the maiden came to a little house in a
moonlit forest-glade and, entering the dwelling,
closed the door gently behind her. A casement
window stood open to the night, the beam of
the golden lantern filled the room, and presently
a voice began to sing a pretty country-tune.
Mingled with the lilt of the ballad was
a strange sound, a purring treading sound
something like the whir of a spinning wheel,
but heavier and with a queer wooden click to it
every tiny while.</p>

<p>Approaching quietly in the moonlight, Alois
rose on tiptoe and gazed within the house.</p>

<p>A single candle in a tall candlestick was burning
at each end of the mantel, candles were
burning in sconces on the wall, and the golden
lantern, still aglow, hung close beside the door.
The maiden of the light was sitting at an oaken
loom, working the treadles with her feet, and
tossing the shuttle back and forth from side
to side. Skeins of golden thread, and white,
and rose, and mulberry, and blue lay at her
fingers’ ends, and on the frame of the loom
stood forth the finished labor, a noble tapestry
in which the maiden had cunningly woven
knights and ladies, banners and tents and men
at arms, and castles moated round with quiet
streams.</p>

<p>This maid in homespun green, I must tell you,
was an orphan lass who earned her bread in the
world by weaving at her loom. It was her custom
to stain the weaving yarns with colors
made of roots and flowers, and she had been
wandering about in search of the starlight
daisy when Alois had seen her lantern on the
hill.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that, as the youth Alois
rode home in the moonlight to his tower, he
could think of naught but the lovely maiden
of the loom and determined to ride forth again,
find her, and make her his wife. On the following
morning, therefore, he rode singing down
the wildwood road to the house in the glade
and asked a cup of water from the maid. And so
graciously and prettily did Fidella&mdash;for this
was the maiden’s name&mdash;offer him the cup,
that Alois thought her more than ever quite
the most charming person in the world.</p>

<p>Months passed, the youth rode every day to
the little house, and presently made so bold
as to ask Fidella to marry him on the morrow’s
morn. Little suspecting that Alois was aught
but a simple squire of the court, the maiden
answered with a nod, and promised to be ready
to ride with him to the village on the hilltop,
and there be wedded by the Master Villager.</p>

<p>And now it was the marriage morn; great
clouds fled over the sun, chilling and quieting
the world, yet every now and then breaking
asunder and dappling the broad land with
spots of sunshine, which gleamed for a moment
and were gone. Dressed in her pretty country
finery, and with a nosegay of posies at her
throat, Fidella stood by her window waiting
to hear the thunder of arriving hoofs and Alois’
joyous hail.</p>

<p>But, alas! little by little the morning dragged
along, the wooden clock on the mantel ticked
and ticked and ticked and ticked, the clouds
gathered in a gray sea over the noontide sun,
yet of Alois came no sign. Early in the afternoon
a gentle windless rain began to fall, and
presently the flowers in the garden hung their
heads in the gathering gloom, as if in sorrow
to see so fair a bride forsaken and forgot.</p>

<p>But now you must hear of what had happened
at the court.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now, after bidding farewell to the maiden of
the loom and promising to return on the following
morn, Alois had gone to his tower and attired
himself in the magnificent costume which court
ceremonial prescribed for all who were fain to
speak with the King. This habit was of richest
white satin, faced with gold; a sword set with
splendid sapphires was belted to its side; and
a short blue-velvet cape, hanging in loose folds,
was secured at the breast by a golden chain.
Now, as Alois was very dark and red-cheeked,
you will see that this costume was really quite
becoming.</p>

<p>Thus arrayed, the youth went boldly to the
King, and spoke freely and frankly of his love
for the maid of the loom and of his purpose to
be married with her on the morrow’s morn.</p>

<p>The King, who sat on his throne clad in a
great scarlet robe and wearing his crown, listened
to Alois with a smile when he began, but
with a frown as the tale drew to an ending.</p>

<p>“Youth,” said the King sternly, “I have
heard enough; this folly must end, and at once.
Are you so far forgetful of your great inheritance
that you must take a weaver’s lass to be your
bride? Go to your tower, and see that you
ride not beyond the castle wall until I speak
the word!”</p>

<p>“But, sir, am I not in this my own master?”
cried Alois, unafraid.</p>

<p>“You are my ward,” replied the King, with
cold authority, “and I have other purposes for
you. Sir Alois, go!”</p>

<p>“Do what you will,” replied the youth; “I
shall have Fidella, and no other.” And holding
his head high, the youth Alois quitted the
audience hall, and mounted to his room.</p>

<p>Now when he had gone, the King, who had
sat silent a moment, chin in hand, suddenly
threw off his crimson robe, called for his coach,
and rode through the wood to a giant tower on
the brink of a wild ravine. A powerful enchanter
dwelt there, whose magic aid and guileful counsel
were ever at the service of the King.</p>

<p>And now the enchanter sat in a huge golden
chair hearkening to the King. He was very old,
this enchanter, and attired in a full black
mantle, spangled with silver stars and golden
crescent-moons; and, as he sat in his golden
chair, he leaned forward and rested his two
hands on a stout black cane. The high round
chamber was full of a cobwebby gloom, and
on shelves in the arched windows stood crystal
flasks of a thousand twisted shapes and colors:
deep ocean-blues, fiery scarlets, smoky purples,
clear topaz yellows, and bright snake-like greens.
And there was a huge black lizard with greeny-scarlet
eyes, that made scaly noises as it ran
about on the flagstones of the floor.</p>

<p>When he had heard the King’s story of Alois
and Fidella, the enchanter smote the floor with
his black cane, rose to his feet, saying never a
word, and took from a niche in the wall a jar
of blackest marble, strangely veined with gold.</p>

<p>“You have done well to come to me,” said the
enchanter to the King, “for the youth is proud-spirited
and will resist you to the end. ’Twere
wisest to bend him to your will by magic guile.
Within this phial dwells the water of forgetfulness;
a goblin brought it me from the depths
of the underworld. To-night you must pour it
forth into a golden goblet, and that goblet you
must stand by the youth’s place at the dinner
of the court. As soon as he drinks of it, he will
forget the weaver’s maid forever.”</p>

<p>And now it was evening, and the King and his
guests were at dinner in the castle banquet-hall.
There were candles everywhere, white
tables and golden plates, and much coming and
going of servants clad in green. From the royal
table, raised above the others, the King watched
Alois through the meal. Suddenly he smiled
a grim smile; the youth had drunk the cup.</p>

<p>When it was late at night the King summoned
Alois before him, stared into his eyes, and beheld
that he had indeed forgotten all.</p>

<p>“My Lord Alois,” said the King, “your coming-of-age
approaches, and you will soon find
yourself the greatest lord in my dominions.
Since you are my ward, it has been my duty to
seek for you a bride worthy of your titles and
estate. In the Kingdom of the Fields a fair
Princess dwells. Melusine is she called, and
to-morrow’s morn you shall go forth in state
to offer her your homage and your hand.”</p>

<p>Thus spake the crafty King, and hid in his
heart his design of adding the Kingdom of the
Fields to his own dominions through the marriage
of the knight and Melusine.</p>

<p>And now it was the morn of cloud and fleeting
gleams of sun. In the little house in the glade,
Fidella stood waiting and waiting at the casement
window; whilst at the court, Alois drew
on his jeweled gloves, bowed to the King,
mounted into the golden coach, and sank back
in splendor against cushions of mulberry brocade.</p>

<p>“Tick-tock, tock-tock, tick-tock,” said the
clock in Fidella’s house, as the hands circled
the hours.</p>

<p>And the golden coach, gleaming great golden
gleams in the pools of light, rolled over the
hills and far away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was twilight now and, in the little house in
the wood, Fidella lifted the bridal wreath from
her head, lit candles, and sank into a wing
chair by the burnt-out embers of the fire. So
great was her trust in Alois, that never a
questioning doubt of him raised its voice in
her heart.</p>

<p>“Some evil thing has surely come to pass,”
said faithful Fidella. “Alas! what may it be?”
And for two days she walked to and fro between
the window and her loom, vainly hoping for
a sign. On the third morning, no longer able
to bear the burden of her fears, the maiden
journeyed to court and sought news of Alois
from the King.</p>

<p>“So you are the maid of the loom?” said the
unpitying King, who owed Fidella a grudge for
having endangered his precious schemes. “And
’tis your Sir Alois whom you seek? Well, find
him if you can. Ho, guards of the palace, take
this forward maid, put her in a coach, and drive
her far beyond the bounds of my dominions!”</p>

<p>Over hill, over dale, bumping through puddle-holes,
and tossing and swaying crazily from
side to side, rolled the coach in which Fidella
sat a prisoner. A rushing scurrying wind was
flowing over the sunny world, shaking the manes
of the galloping horses, rippling the roadside
pools, and worrying the little birds who had
just begun to fly. Presently Fidella found herself
on a lonely moor, watching the coach fare
homeward into the wind-streaked splendor of
the west.</p>

<p>And now began the wayfaring of Fidella in
quest of Alois, for the King had forbidden the
maid to return again into her own land. Down
the highway of the Golden Plain she fared and
beheld the grain tossing about her like a sea;
through the silence of the Adamants she passed,
and on into the Kingdom by the peaks; yet
never a word of Alois brought joy to her ear.</p>

<p>Now it fortuned on a spring morning, as
Fidella wandered in a pleasant land of wooded
hills and little singing brooks, she came to the
strangest palace that was ever to be seen. Of
earth o’ergrown with grass were its mighty
walls and lofty battlements; flowers grew in
the crannies; blossoming vines swayed from
its heights; and, when the maiden peered within,
she beheld there a woodsy hall, whose giant
columns were the trunks of living trees. At
the far end of the hall, on a throne of living
wood, sat a dark and stately queen. Twelve
maidens stood beside her, three robed in summer
scarlet, three in winter white, three in
springtide emerald, and three in russet gold.</p>

<p>The lady of the palace was Airda, the great
Earth Queen. Four sons had she, and each
son was master of a season of the year.</p>

<p>“My faithful Fidella,” said the Earth Queen,
when she had heard the maiden’s story, “be of
good cheer, for all that hath been hid from you
shall now be known. An enchanted torrent
through my palace flows; its waters possess the
gift of speech, and to every mystery it hath a
secret key. Follow, Fidella, to the grotto of
the stream.”</p>

<p>Now rose the Earth Queen from her throne
and led the way through the cool sweet-smelling
chambers of the palace to a strange dark grotto,
half cave, half vine-hung hall. At the darker
end of the leafy cave a lovely waterfall, whose
torrent was full of a pale mysterious light, was
leaping from some height overhead into a chasm
so profound that only the faintest watery murmur
rose in whispers from below. Kneeling
upon the brink of the chasm, Fidella gazed
down into the palely glowing depths of the
abyss and asked of Alois and his fate.</p>

<p>For a moment or two, the waters far below
seemed to gather themselves into a faint echoing
roar, which slowly ebbed to a whisper; and
presently this whisper became a voice, and dissolved
into delicate and silvery words. And the
voice of the enchanted chasm told Fidella of
Alois’ true faith, of the enchanter and the water
of forgetfulness, and of the youth’s journey to
the court of the Kingdom of the Fields.</p>

<p>“Ah, me! Is there no way in which the spell
may be broken?” said Fidella.</p>

<p>“In the wood beyond the world,” answered
the torrent, “under trees which are older than
the stars, the fountain of memory pours its
crystal stream. If the youth shall drink a
golden goblet of this water, the chain of the
spell will break.” And the silvery voice grew
faint, and died away.</p>

<p>And now Airda, the Earth Queen, gave the
maiden a fair golden goblet with a golden
cover, and bade her sail upon the giant ship of
the earth to the wood beyond the world.</p>

<p>When the maiden arrived at the sea, the sun
had vanished below mountains to the west,
the waves were breaking gently along a darkening
shore, and ragged hulks of cloud were lying
becalmed in the deep and starry sky. Far, far
out to sea, rising from the waters like the blue
bulwark of another land and bridging the vast
horizon from west unto the south, stood the
giant ship of Airda, the Queen. So high were its
masts that their tops could scarce be seen in the
dome of the heavens, clouds swept through the
royal yards, and the lights within the rigging
floated like stars upon the sky.</p>

<p>Three days’ journey long, and close upon a
day’s journey wide, was the giant ship. Its
sails were the size of towns, and a sailor on
horseback carried the captain’s orders to the
crew. And there were villages aboard, and
wide fields in which men were ploughing, and
grazing cattle, and highways, and inns wherein
travelers might rest.</p>

<p>Now came the dark, a wind rose upon the sea,
the black clouds moved through the stars, and
a little boat came to take Fidella to the ship.
Once aboard, the maiden was given a pretty
cottage with a garden to be her very own.</p>

<p>And, sailing by night and by day, furrowing
vast and lonely seas, the giant ship came to the
wood beyond the world.</p>

<p>The fountain of memory lay at the foot of the
noblest of the trees, and the silvery music of its
falling water was the only sound to be heard in
all the wood. A hooded figure of worn and
ancient stone, standing with head bowed low,
held aloft the jar from which it flowed, an
endless crystal stream.</p>

<p>And Fidella, stooping to fill her cup in the
basin of stone below, saw mirrored in the water
there, gathering and dissolving one into the
other, memories of all the years of her life which
had been.</p>

<p>Once more through the lonely seas sailed the
giant ship of Airda the Queen, Fidella again
beheld the land, and presently she fared over
hill and dale to the Kingdom of the Fields.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The winter was over and gone, and all the
towns and villages of the realm were decked
with bannerets and wreaths of early flowers,
for in three days’ time the Lord Alois was to
wed the Princess Melusine.</p>

<p>Presently Fidella, journeying through the
land, arrived on the crest of a hill overlooking
the royal city and, pausing there a while, took
counsel with herself as to how she might best
make her way to Alois and offer him the cup
of memory.</p>

<p>“I must find me a loom,” said faithful Fidella,
“and weave upon it a wedding gift so worthy
that the lords of the castle will suffer me to go
with it to Alois.”</p>

<p>And she sought out a house and a loom in a
village by the city, and paid for them with a
penny of gold. And from one neighbor she had
silver yarn; and from another, blue; and from
others, all the colors of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowe180" id="wood" style="max-width: 28em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/wood.jpg" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><i>Fidella knelt at the edge of the pool, and filled her golden cup with
the waters of memory</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>And now Fidella began to weave a fair tapestry
picture of the story she had lived, beginning the
tale with the golden light in the wood and the
coming of Alois to the glade. Thread by thread,
inch by inch, the grass-palace of Airda grew on
the loom, the cave of the talking waters, the
giant ship with its masts above the clouds, and
the fountain of memory in the wood beyond
the world. The sun set behind the high towers
of the city, and still Fidella labored at the loom;
candles melted low, and still the sound of the
weaving hummed upon the air.</p>

<p>In the dark of the second night, as Fidella rose
to toss a brand upon the fire, she heard, through
the quiet of the room, the distant beat of galloping
hoofs and the thundering rumble of a
coach. Louder and louder grew the sound, and
presently there passed the maiden’s dwelling a
huge coach speeding from the city. Strange to
tell, its lanterns were unlit and its curtains
closely drawn.</p>

<p>“Perchance some noble guest hath been
summoned posthaste to his realm,” thought
Fidella.</p>

<p>And now it was the morn, the marriage morn
of the Knight Alois and the Princess Melusine.
Alas, still unfinished was the picture tapestry!
Fearing to risk a single moment more, however,
the maiden unbound the picture from the loom
and, carrying the gift and her golden cup, joined
the merrymakers thronging to the city. The
streets were already full of soldiers in gayest
uniforms, strolling musicians, young nobles,
larking pages, good countryfolk, and sober
burgesses in velvet gowns. Those who brought
gifts for Alois and Melusine were faring into
the castle through the eastern gate.</p>

<p>The bells of the castle were ringing as they
never rang before.</p>

<p>Fidella approached to the portal with her gift.
A haughty chamberlain, with a silver chain
about his shoulders, stood there by the thresh-hold
and suffered only those to enter in whom
he thought well worthy of the boon.</p>

<p>“But my good young woman,” said the chamberlain
severely to Fidella, “your tapestry is
unfinished still. Go to your home and weave
it to an end ere you return again. You may
not enter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” cried poor Fidella, “do not thrust
me back! Let me enter, I pray; oh, let me go
within!”</p>

<p>“What I have said, I have said,” replied the
chamberlain, shouting at Fidella through the
deafening clangor of the bells. “Young woman,
I forbid&mdash;”</p>

<p>Suddenly the bells stopped in the middle
of a peal, and everything grew very strangely
still. People began to look questioningly at
one another.</p>

<p>The Princess Melusine was not to be found!
She had fled during the night with her cousin,
the King of the Golden Hill. The coach, which
Fidella had seen, had borne the runaway bride.
As for the knight Alois, some said that he had
already left the realm, whilst others murmured
that he was hiding for shame in a tower. And
many laughed.</p>

<p>Thrust from the portal by the guards, Fidella
returned to her cottage in the fields.</p>

<p>And now it was night, the air was sweet with
the fragrance of earth beneath the plough, and
a sickle moon hung in the cloudy west with the
old moon in her arms. Within her silent house
Fidella kindled a yellow fire, threw the tapestry
picture over the loom, and stood by the hearth
gazing deep into the flame.</p>

<p>Suddenly a knocking sounded at the door, and
Fidella, answering the summons, found herself
standing face to face with the young knight,
Alois. His pride touched to the quick, the forsaken
youth had lingered in the castle till the
dark, and then fled with his people from the
town. And, because he had fled in haste and
was athirst, the youth had paused at the first
light shining in the fields.</p>

<p>Standing on the threshold in the moonlight,
the youth asked a cup of water of the maid.
With a beating heart, Fidella lifted to his hands
the cup of memory.</p>

<p>And now there came an end to the enchanter’s
wicked spell and the long years of danger and
faithful questing. Letting fall the golden cup,
the young knight uttered a great cry and
stretched out his arms to the faithful maid for
whose sake he had braved the anger of the
King, the loyal maid who had loved him with
a loving faith and braved many a peril for him
through the kingdoms of the world.</p>

<p>“Dear Fidella,” said Alois, “to-day is the
day of my coming-of-age, and I am free forever
of the King. Now shall you be the Lady of my
land. Come; my people and my coach are at
the door.”</p>

<p>So now Fidella quenched the taper, leaving
only a flickering brand to light the empty room,
and walked with Alois to the coach. A little
breeze was stirring in the grass, and somewhere
in a glen beyond the fields a bird awoke, sang
a few sweet piping notes, and then was still.</p>

<p>“I am glad I did not finish my tapestry,”
whispered Fidella; “for now I can weave it to
a merry close.”</p>

<p>And the coach rolled away, over hill, over dale,
in the golden light of the moon.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
